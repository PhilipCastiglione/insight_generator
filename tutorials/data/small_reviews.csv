"daniel is the most amazing host! his place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). he is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. highly recommended!"
"we had such a great time in amsterdam. daniel is an excellent host! very friendly and everytime helpful. the room was cozy, comfortable, and very clean. maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. bathroom with all the bathroom requires. good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.  totally recommendable! "
very professional operation. room is very clean and comfortable. location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. a great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
daniel is highly recommended.  he provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). his place is very clean.  it is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  you will truly feel like a local here.
"daniel was a great host! he made everything so easy for us! the room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. the place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. i highly recommend daniele's place!    "
daniele is an amazing host! he provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! the rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. you truly do feel like a local when staying with daniele!!  
"you can´t have a nicer start in amsterdam. daniel is such a great and welcoming host. the room was really light and charming, so well decorated. daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. he´s very open minded and helpful. we had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in amsterdam. daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! hope to see you soon, daniel!"
"daniel was a fantastic host. his place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of amsterdam. should i return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
daniel was great. he couldn.t do enough for us. he has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. he can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.  the accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram.
"daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in amsterdam!  if friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! the location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. and don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
"daniel's apartment and room was spotless. daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when i arrived (late). the apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. i would not hesitate to stay here again. daniel is wonderful host."
"daniel was an exeptional host!! we only had a short stay in amsterdam but daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. his place was very clean and comfortable. daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in amsterdam. our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. totally, totally, totally recommend daniel's place next time you visit amsterdam."
"no amount of praise for daniel would be corny or excessive.  his place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  i felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  a friend and i stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  the shower was luxurious and clean, and daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  i just asked my travel companion ""what else can i say about daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""oh man!  it's one thing to expect breakfast from a b&b, and it's quite another to be chez daniel.  his command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
"it's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  moreover with the hash from island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. so thanks you daniel. if you have to come to amsterdam, choose the daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
"when you reach at dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. may it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""things to do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. nothing misses out from daniel's radar.  his pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.we would definately stay with him again.thanks again for making us feel at home."
"daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. i would stay with daniel again anytime. "
daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
"our stay with daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind european tour. not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think zen), but having daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. from the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in amsterdam.     the room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. we were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. and staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.    i would recommend daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. as a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming.     p.s. you can check my youtube page for videos of our stay in amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (website hidden by airbnb)"
"daniel was very accomodating and friendly. it was a little pricey for what it was. the bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, i would know. the neighborhood seemed relatively safe but i did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. overall, i was impressed but i probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
daniel's place was great! we got so much relaxing in. we loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! he gave us great tips on getting around etc. i would recommend his place to anyone traveling to amsterdam.
"just a short note - my first experience with airbnb was with daniel and it was stellar.  exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  as a person who does a lot of business travelling, i found daniel to be an informed and professional host.  much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  for example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  he also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  i highly recommend daniel to anyone considering a trip to amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
"daniel was an exceptional host!  i was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:    1) friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- along with my reservation i received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  one evening daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  we also spent time talking about the culture of holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).    2) cleanliness of the place -- daniel's apartment is spotless.  the particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.    3) all the ""little extras"" -- daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  he also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which i could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my us plugs.  everything was well thought-out and daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
"daniel is a great host. he is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. his apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). he provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that i can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.  thank you daniel."
"we spent two nights at daniel's and very much enjoyed it. early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. the room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. his place is a bit out of the central area of amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. it was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. we would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
"daniel was an excellent host, and i whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. he is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. on my next visit to amsterdam, i would absolutely stay with daniel again. "
daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in amsterdam. he was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. he definitely comes excellently-recommended!
"daniel's setup was very good.  like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.      daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  he helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.    his place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  so it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.    there are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  would definitely stay there agin."
"our stay at daniel was awesome. he has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. the room to rent is also very nice. it has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. there are also towels for which daniel provides a special space in the bathroom.   what was outstanding, was that daniel also lent us two of his bikes. this was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover amsterdam by bike. even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
"my stay with daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam. not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable , but having daniel as a point of reference was my key to discovering the city. from the get-go he freely offered advice whenever i had questions about where to go or what to do in amsterdam. the room is located at quite 15 minut from the heart of the city, but i didn't find this hindering. i was able to get to the center in 15 minut. also the bus stop is only 3 minut walk from the house . there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. and staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living. i would recommend daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels.definetly will be goin there again thank you daniel so much for everything u done for me to make my stay very confortable..      "
"daniel makes his guests feel completely welcome,  he checks in to make sure you are having a great time and if you need anything further. he is always available by phone. the room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the amsterdam seamlessly.  the room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. i would definitely stay at daniel's again.  i had a great time."
"daniel's place was without a doubt the most rewarding of our trip to europe. his attention to details and kindness make his place an excellent alternative for those considering a bed and breakfast in amsterdam  i strongly advise to consider his place: great location, an affordable price, a clean and organized room and a great host. what else can you ask for?  thanks daniel  hope to see u soon!"
"my sister and i had a awesome experience in amsterdam and it all started with daniel, his graciousness as a host - helping us find his quiet apartment, his tea and conversations, maps, comfortable room and accommadations. we would definately stay at daniel's the next time we visit amsterdam. "
"staying st daniel's was flawless, everything was perfect. daniel has everything well organized and well planned for the guests. he provides maps and books of amsterdam, and he is always available for any help you might need.    the room is very quiet, and well decorated, very clean.  he provides the room with towels, tea, coffee and a wardrobe.    i felt very comfortable, i would stay again. "
daniel's place was very nice and the neighbourhood was good as well. everything very close and reachable. if you are travelling outside amsterdam for business the station and public transport is very convinient.    daniel is a great host. always recomendable.    regards  rahul
"me and my boyfriend have spent three nights at daniel´s place, and we are very pleased with the choice. daniel is charming, always aware that everything was fine. his house is very nice, very clean and beautiful. the room is very nice and the beds are very comfortable. we had at our disposal free bikes, coffee ant tea, guides, towels, hair dryer...  the only downside is that we couldn´t be much with daniel, who was a lovely person!  if we go back to amsterdam we would repeat for sure!  thank you daniel!"
daniel provides 5 star service. he is a super nice guy and he is super friendly and well organized. i was traveling with a buddy and everything worked out great. my stay was over a year ago and i only just figured out how to write a review. happy travels everyone !
"daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. it's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and daniel is a fantastic host.     slightly outside the 'core' of amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules.     only thing i'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what european apartments are actually like. daniel's is really, really nice - but it is european. if you're fresh off the plane from north america and have never been to europe before i'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. but i'd say that about any european apartment.     hugely enjoyed my time. highly recommend.  "
"staying at daniel's apartment was great! my boyfriend and i stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. the room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. he was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. he even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! he was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. the location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. i would absolutely recommend staying here! "
"daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. it is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. the area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. the apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. the kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. it is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. the bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. there were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. he has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. his manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  in short: go to amsterdam, rent daniel's appartment and be happy. thanks again, daniel for a great stay! angela (brazil)."
"great trip, accomodation was very clean and daniel was very welcoming and professional. he provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of amsterdam. would highly recommend a stay at daniel's. "
"daniel is an amazing host!  the room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  there is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  the environment was exceptionally clean, organized and daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  he was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  the most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  it was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  everything is close.  daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  i highly recommend daniel's place.  "
we spent  a few day by daniel. we have a very good accomotion. daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. we will come back to amsterdam and defently go to daniel. 
"daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with. the room is attractive and very comfortable. the location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in amsterdam. don't hesitate to ask daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. his recommendations are excellent!    we loved our stay in amsterdam and would gladly stay with daniel again."
"daniel is a very kind, helpful, and nice host. we were amazed at his careful attention at every detail for the guests. everything was very clean as a nice hotel. the room is so cozy and bright, you can even see a nice little garden from the window.     we did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources daniel provided us. all the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room!     if you a big fan of thai food, ask daniel where to go for your first meal in amsterdam near his place- it was the best.     thank you daniel!!!  sunny k"
"daniel is a phenomenal host; he has everything you could need and has an answer for every question we had.  the room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  the location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. i will definitely stay with daniel again and i have already recommended his room to family and friends."
"daniel is an outstanding host. he is extraordinarily organized & tidy. the room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. there is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. it is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. it is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to amsterdam centraal station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. highly recommended! i would definitely stay again."
"daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host!     his place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. from the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what airbnb should be like.    especially grateful for countless hours daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.    his home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. the bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.    highly recommend his home for exploring amsterdam. there is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called oosterpark and it was delightful!"
"our stay with daniel was enjoyable - our only complaint was the non-stop-rain during our visit, and really daniel could have done nothing about this!"
"daniel is a great host, he is very helpful and he can give you any info about amsterdam you need. the room as well as the bathroom and toilet are very clean. daniel's place is located 1,4 km away from a park+ride, in a nice neighborhood and is really good connected to the city center.  highly recommended!"
"daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. his place was impeccable. when we arrived (which was late, and our eta was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. overall, a fantastic experience i would recommend to everyone.     thanks daniel!  adam&jess"
"daniel was an absolute dream host. his place is so clean, he is extremely organized and super sweet. we had such a great time in amsterdam and daniel had a major part of that. i can't tell you how much i recommend staying with him! thanks daniel!!!!!!"
daniel is a great host even before reaching ams he gave us good directions on how to get to his place. leaving @ daniels was wonderful. he has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. on our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. we had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. ams is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @daniels again :)
"we felt very much welcomed at daniel's place. very thing is well organized, you are provided with eveything you need, the room is pleasant and daniel is a sensitive and sensible host. it felt a bit like home :-) "
"daniel was a great host! this was our first time staying in a b&b and let's just say he set the bar really high. his home was extremely clean and very well organized. the garden view was so peaceful. both my bf and myself were sick during our europe trip and daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. he was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. the room came equipped with coffee and tea and wifi. his home is very close to public transportation and getting to central amsterdam was a breeze. if i ever come back to amsterdam i would definitely be staying at his place again. "
"i have nothing but praise for this gem of a place. daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in amsterdam truly memorable. the room provided a 5* experience and has everything you would possibly need for your stay. the apartment is tastefully decorated with beautiful artwork that is truly inspiring. if you are in amsterdam, this is the place you should stay. you won't regret it. :)"
daniel's is fantastic!   great location. quiet room. good beds. fantastic bathroom. spotlessly clean. nice host. fun bikes!  he has thought of everything to make his guests comfortable. we enjoyed our stay in amsterdam very much thanks to daniel!  definitely recommend and would love to go back.
"fun guy, easy to get along with. good location to see the sights of barcelona which are many. enjoyed the dialogue and chatting. recommended as a great host. "
"i stayed with my partner at daniel's place for almost a week and we see daniel as the perfect host. from the first moment he welcomed us in a very kindly, respectful and positive way. he provided us information about many places to go and he was always showing us the best alternatives in amsterdam. at his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected. definitively daniel has done everything as possible to make our stay more enjoyable. the place is perfect and highly recommended."
"i was most satisfied with my stay in daniel's place.  it was cozy, clean, and quiet.  daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  on getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what i wanted in the time i had.  he provided privacy though i knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  i would recommend his place to my friends.  his place is in a very convenient and safe area.  i would definitely look into his place if i had another chance to go to amsterdam. thanks, daniel."
"wonderful, quiet and relaxing is the best way to describe daniels apartment. plus, daniel was very accommodating and extremely helpful with directions. i would recommend daniels apartment to anyone that is looking for a relaxing environment while visiting amsterdam. "
the reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
"we were very well received and his place was very clean. he's kind and wants you to feel at home. our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. as long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.    "
"my friend and i really enjoyed our stay in amsterdam - daniel is so friendly  and hospitable - the greatest example of this was when we were returning to the central station, he rode his bike to give me my tiny earrings which were the only thing i forgot. he also made sure we had coffee and tea in the morning. "
"to describe our stay at daniel's place in two words: absolutely wonderfull. not only is daniel a kind and caring person, but also a very attentive host who kept everything spotless. although the apartment is close to the city center, we were more than thankfull that he lend us some bike for a real amsterdam experience. but most of all, we really felt at home. thank you, daniel :)"
"daniel was absolutely fantastic! communication was great and he gave us tons of good amsterdam tips. he was very accessible, but let us have our space.  the apartment itself is incredibly clean, the room is a good size and very easy access to city center, rijksmuseum, vondelpark, and the train station - a 10 minute bus ride. great wifi, tea and coffee in the room, this was a home away from home and a great first stop on our journey. this is a wonderful stay for 2 people, and i would definitely stay here again!"
"just spent only three nights staying at daniel's....wish it could have been a lot more.  if you want to stay at a place that is impeccably clean, organized, and with a great host then daniel's is the place.  daniel will do everything to make your stay enjoyable. "
"of all the airbnb places i've stayed at, daniel has been the most professional host i've come across. every bit of required information was provided before arrival, and the apartment was very clean and organized. the room looks just like it does in the pictures - well lit and colorful. only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. the room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. the neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. overall, very comfortable stay!"
"daniel was a very kind and gracious host. zeeberg is an interesting area that is a little rundown compared to other parts of amsterdam but they're obviously working to improve it. traveling to and from centraal was quick and easy, especially with daniel's guidance on the transit system. additionally, how daniel handled wifi access and the keypads for the apartment was flawless and inventive. "
"daniel est très hospitalier. il est amical et fait en sorte que vous passiez un bon séjour chez lui et vous conseille sur la ville.  son appartement est très propre, très bien rangé.  l'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports.  mon ami et moi-même avons été très satisfaits de notre séjour passé dans son appartement.  daniel is very hospitable. he is friendly and makes sure you have a good stay at home and advise you on the town.  his apartment is very clean, very tidy.  the apartment is very well served by public transport.  my friend and i were very satisfied with our stay in his apartment."
i traveled first time to amsterdam with a friend and we stayed at daniel´s.he was an excelent host with helping to find out routes and gave lots of tips how to handle things in amsterdam.the place was very clean and quiet.we recomment daniel´s room. thank´s for your service.
"super séjour à amsterdam et ce en partie grâce à notre hébergement de qualité. daniel est vraiment très aimable, prend soin que vous ayez tout a votre disposition (par exemple nous avons eu la chance d'avoir des vélos de prêts pour les 5 jours sur place ce qui nous a beaucoup simplifié les trajets). la chambre en soi est très mignone, avec, encore une fois, tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin à votre disposition. l'endroit est calme, plaisant, et extrêmement bien tenu! je recommande à tous ceux qui souhaitent visiter amsterdam en paix (ou y faire la fête) ce super logement!"
"daniel is a a very organized and professional host. a lot of information is at the hands of the guest from the very start. tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. the house is extremely clean. there are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. i would not hesitate to recommend daniel to other people that want to stay in amsterdam."
"daniel is a great host, his place is immaculate and comfortable. daniel provided my friend and i with all the information we needed and then some. i would recommend daniel's place to friends and family, no complaints what so ever."
daniel is the good host! he provided all necessary information of the trip for us.  his place is so peaceful and cleanses. it is near to tramp and bus station just 2-3 minutes by walk. we feel safe and comfort at daniel place. 
"daniel was very professional, welcoming and friendly. his apartment is lovely, relaxing and calming. it was impeccable and the beds were so comfortable. i loved staying here. if you go to amsterdam, i highly recommend staying with daniel. he provided maps and information and thought of everything possible to make my stay in pleasant.  the apartment is situated near to a tram stop so it was easy to get to and from the city center.   "
"sehr saubere und gepflegte wohnung. daniel war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. die verkehrsanbindung ist super. man ist in ca. 10 min. am hauptbahnhof. ich würde jederzeit wieder bei daniels übernachten, wenn ich in amsterdam bin."
"he was a very nice host.  myself and my fiancee stayed for 3 days in amsterdam and we had a great time staying with daniel.  he gave us help of where to go in the city, he rented bikes to us, and he gave us a map that was extremely useful in getting around.  he is very well organized and the whole stay was great and very easy."
"we had a amazing stay at daniel's.  the living space, room, and bathroom facilities are kept immaculate.  the neighborhood is very peaceful, quiet, and extremely well-connected to central amsterdam, though several eateries and cafes are within a 5-minute walk.   there is also a well-maintained park (flevopark) at the end of the street servicing nature-lovers and runners.  last but not least, daniel is both available, accommodating, and kind.  do not think twice about this place!!!"
daniel is a very friendly and helpful person. he makes our stay in amsterdam perfect! i just can advise him. 
tutto perfetto...    grazie mille
"we stayed at daniel's for 5 nights. his apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). besides, there is a table and a small fridge. the shower (separate from the wc)  is also very good. the apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. there are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go.   daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in ams. our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. i am sure daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in amsterdam. i also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! definitely recommend! "
un séjour remarquable !  daniel est un hôte soucieux du bien- être des gens qu'ils accueillent.  toujours disponible et fier de partager ses connaissances de sa ville pour faciliter notre séjour.  un environnement fort jolie et très propre et un décor soigné quoi demander de mieux !
"we had great time during the stay at daniel’s home.  we felt like we are home for 4 nights. he was very kind and helpful.  the room was very clean and quite. and there was a garden out of window in the room. in the every morning, when we woke up, we could see the bird’s tweet with the breeze softly. how can the morning be better?  in the night, the curtains block the light completely during sleeping.  only alarm could interrupt our sleeping.    the bathroom was also very clean. the toiletries were all good stuff.  it was filled with the aroma. also, it was good to take a shower with good temperature and water pressure.    first of all, his house is always neat and clean. and he knew everything for the trip in amsterdam. also, we had a pleasant conversation with him.  thank you, daniel."
i had a good stay at daniels place which was very clean and functional. it was also very well decorated and daniel is very friendly and helpful!
"daniel was an excellent host! he greeted my friend and i with open arms, and was a superb resource for us. the personal maps he gave us were so handy! he went above and beyond our expectations when he was able to arrange his schedule to accept my friend's late baggage while we were enjoying the city.  i would recommend daniel's place to everyone ! it is so close to the city center and the place is incredibly clean and comfortable! i wish we were there longer and i hope to return some day! "
"not sure what else can be said about daniel.  he is a true gentleman and was always ready with any answers (or bandaids) we needed!  his attention to detail made us feel like we were at a 5 star hotel.  the neighborhood has restaurants, bars, markets and even an awesome looking playground!   if we ever make it back to amsterdam i won't even bother looking for somewhere else to stay!"
"my experience in amsterdam was brilliant. from daniels appartment i had close access to buses and/or trams, so getting to the city centre was easy. a simple 5 minute journey.  daniel as a host was superb, very relaxed atmosphere in his home, and he provided us with lots of information including places to go/see. i recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  brilliant time. til next time!"
"daniel was a very helpful host. upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. he provided us with clear directions and maps of amsterdam. he made it so easy to explore amsterdam using public transport. he was always available and happy to answer question. he was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. he was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. the bed were very comfortable. i bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. we had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. i would recommend staying with daniel."
"after we arrived daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. we proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people i have stayed with through airbnb. in his apartment are countless books about amsterdam that one can leaf through. however, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. he provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. it was a warm and informative welcome.     the accommodations were spectacular. there are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. the room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. we were never cold. the bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. the orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds.     the location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. if one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. it is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. the apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that amsterdam harbors. the area is quiet but active. staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. there is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. flevo park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which amsterdam is rooted.      to the host himself: daniel is helpful. he makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. he takes care of without meddling over you. you could talk to him not only about amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. we had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. if you wish to visit amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."
"daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. his appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. hence we really enjoyed staying with him.       after booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.    when we arrived in amsterdam, we got a phone call from daniel making sure we found his place okay. he is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in english.     upon arriving in niasstraat, anna and i realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. to our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity.     we were greeted by daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. we were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with african wooden figures, listening to the pachelbel canon.   he gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules.     you could tell from every detail that daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. his wifi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. we were positively surprised!   for security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.    after that he gave us the tour of his appartement. it’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.  there are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. they were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. another smart detail.   the room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day.   wifi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two android smartphones). enough for (hidden by airbnb) , but not enough for watching youtube clips. a wifi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem.     after this he showed us the bathroom. i was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. the bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. the toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.      we can highly recommend @daniel's and if we'll be visting amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.      hartstikke bedankt daniel!"
"staying at daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. he welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.  the room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. the beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. he provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.  his daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.  i would stay at his place again anytime. highly recommended."
"daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles! er macht es dir leicht, dich willkommen zu fühlen und hilft wo er kann, um den aufenthalt in amsterdam zu genießen. ich habe gut geschlafen, es war sehr sauber und ordentlich und ich habe einfach nichts, aber auch gar nichts zu beanstanden. wenn daniel gekonnt hätte, hätte er bestimmt auch gerne für besseres wetter gesorgt! ein total netter gastgeber! ich komme gerne wieder..."
daniel was a great host. he gave us very detailed directions to his place and upon our arrival he provided us with maps and places to visit in amsterdam. the room was very neat and tidy. we were also provided with clean towels. daniel's place also has easy public transport to get around. daniel was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. highly recommended.
"daniel's place is amazing and he does an incredible job with hospitality. everything was incredibly clean and he pretty much thought of everything (it was like staying in a little hotel inside his apartment). he was also very responsive when it came to any issues (had some issues with the wifi the first day and he took care of it right away). if you're looking for a great place to stay away from all the tourist rabble, i highly suggest daniel's place. "
daniel was a great host. he had prepared anything we might need during our stay. he was also very professional and his phone was always open in case we needed to contact him. the flat was very clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. i would definitely recommend staying here.
daniel is nice. it was fun. 
"daniel was an incredible host. the room looked exactly how it does in the picture. he was incredibly helpful, and supplied any and everything we needed.  his neighborhood is lovely and close to bus routes that go directly to the towns center. i would stay here each time  i revisit amsterdam, and i'd recommend anyone i know to do the same. "
a really great airbnb experience with daniel. he was very friendly and helpful. the room is very nice and clean. got everything we need.     this was a just short trip to catch up with my friend from overseas and both of us didn't spend too much time to plan the trip beforehand. but with daniel's advice we did manage to have some great time in amsterdam. 
daniel was a wonderful host and the room was just as described/pictured.  he was able to provide good recommendations for what to do and had available things that travels need but tend to forget.  we rented bikes (for a small additional daily fee) -- that were in great condition and included everything we needed to be able to lock them up and ride safely at night -- and we found them to be a great way to get to know amsterdam quickly and efficiently.  the neighborhood is very nice and it's easy to get to the heart of amsterdam by bus or bike.  highly recommended.
"i had a really wonderful stay at daniel's. daniel went above and beyond what i would expect from a host. the place is impeccable, comfortable and a really great to stay for a few days in amsterdam! i absolutely recommend staying with him."
"esta ha sido nuestra primera experiencia con airbnb y la verdad, no hemos podido hacer mejor elección. daniel es un encanto de persona hemos estado muy cómodas, cuida el mínimo detalle para hacerte sentir 100% como en casa. aparte de ser una persona encantadora es muy servicial y en todo momento nos facilitó todo tipo de información necesaria para nuestro viaje sea del tipo que sea. es muy atento y le puedes pedir cualquier cosa, la verdad es que cuida mucho a sus huéspedes y hace que te lleves un gran recuerdo de su casa y de la ciudad, que, por cierto, ánimo a todo el mundo a visitarla.  por otro lado, comentar también que las fotos de la habitación son tal cual,es decir, no te llevas ningún tipo de desengaño tema foto vs realidad.  desde aquí aprovecho para mandarle un saludo a daniel.  muchísimas gracias por todo.  laia"
"daniel's home was beautiful!  it is just as pictured!  his home was very clean and neat!  as soon as we arrived, daniel showed us around his home and we had a cup of tea.  he told us everything we needed to know and let us ask him any questions we had!! his home is very organized and was color-coordinated as far as towels and bathroom items!  he had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! we got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! it's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! and daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average dutch neighborhood!  our stay was short, 3 nights, but daniel made us feel at home and we loved our cozy beds to crawl into at night! i would definitely stay here again! daniel and his home were perfect! "
"daniels apartment is just as showed in the pictures, it was extremely clean, and daniel was a great host, he was very helpful, providing information on how to get to his apartment and to the airport. we didn't see him much, but he was always reachable to answer all of our questions. the location of the apartment was very good, just like 15 minutes to the central station by bus. i would defiantly recomend this apartment, very well located in a quiet neighborhood ,with a lot of cafes, and very easy to access to the center, daniel was a great host, really helpful, and respectful of their guests privacy."
"we had a great stay at daniel's.    the room is exactly as described. everything was spot clean, we were provided with several bath towels, plenty of storage room, and multiple guidebooks and maps of the city.    daniel was a great host, very eager to help and always available a text message away when he wasn't home.     definitely recommend staying at his place. the location is great too with the city centre only a short bus trip or cycle ride away !"
daniels unterkunft ist ein perfekter ort um in amsterdam zu übernachten. die anbindung mit bus und bahn ist perfekt. man kann auch zu fuß die innenstadt gut erreichen und auf dem weg gibt es einiges zu entdecken. die betten sind gemütlich und die wohnung geschmackvoll eingerichtet. daniel hatte gute tipps für uns und ist ein sehr angenehmer zeitgenosse. mein persönlicher tipp ist das thai restaurant in der javastraat um die ecke. nächstes mal in amsterdam bin ich gerne wieder gast dort. thank's for the time at your place. see you next time. peace. 
"we had a lovely stay in daniel's home. he made us feel very welcome and was very happy to help, giving us ideas of places to visit or answering any questions we had. he gave us a map which helped us easily find public transport into the city centre. the flat was very clean and well furnished for visitors- thank you for such a wonderful stay, we would definitely recommend staying with you! "
my stay at daniel was good. he did a great job of staying in contact with through all my traveling delays. daniel's place is a about a 12 minute bus ride away from central amsterdam. the place is very clean and quiet. the only thing missing would be television in the room. if you are looking to enjoy and explore amsterdam this is a good place. 
"this was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience.  i cannot recommend daniel enough, he was so accommodating, he went out of his way to get the answers to our questions, it was very convenient that he had his own bikes for us to rent. he messaged me all the time to make sure i was ok and would also give a prompt reply if i asked him a question. the place was very clean and looks exactly the same as the pictures.  i highly recommend daniel and would defiantly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam.   thank you for a pleasant stay daniel."
"l'hôte était très accueillant, et nous a tout de suite fait sentir à l'aise. tout est mis en place pour que le séjour se passe le mieux possible !"
"daniel is very kind , the flat is very clean ,quiet and exactly as described.i recommend it !"
"very comfortable &clean room,daniel is really gentle and nice,he gave us many helpful informations and make us feel like sleeping at our own  house."
"daniel was extremely friendly and accommodating. place was clean and tidy, everything worked. his directions on finding the place and looking around were also most appreciated."
"daniel was an excellent host! he gave us every information that we need thoughout our stay in amsterdam and he was very willing to help us. also, the room is exactly the same as the photos which is very tidy and well equipped. we love our stay in daniel's place and it was a pleasure for us to meet such a nice host. thanks a lot daniel!"
"staying at daniel's was great. he welcomed us with a beer, gave us all the info we needed, his apartment was spotless clean and most important, he has two bikes that you can rent. and when in amsterdam having a bike is a must have. we had a great time in amsterdam and at daniel's.      "

"daniel was a great host! i felt most welcome upon arrival. he was kind, and helpful in every way possible. the room was clean, spacious, and well lit and maintained. i would recommend this to anyone!"
"daniel was incredibly welcoming and ensured that all and any concerns i had were met immediately with rectification. i would say generally, he went above and beyond the call of duty.    the apartment was well situated in terms of public transport links and is walking distance (with good shoes) from the city.    would definitely recommend staying at daniel's"
"we had a wonderful experience @ daniel's. daniel was the perfect host - friendly, attentive and always available. he provided us with a much appreciated glass of water on arrival after taking our bags, and gave us a debrief on accessing the city via public transport. he provided us with maps to use for the buses as well as for the bikes (if you have the chance to utilise the bikes available for hire, definitely do so! you won't regret it!). the public transport is very easy to use - roughly a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and a 12 minute bus ride into the city. we had no trouble getting anywhere. daniel was sure to check in with us over the few days that we stayed to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. the room was well serviced. he looked after us so well. thank you daniel!"
nice and quite room located in a gentrified area of amsterdam apart from the touristic hot spots. i really enjoyed my stay not at least due to the charming host.
"l'appartamento è molto pulito. daniel è molto accogliente, attento ad ogni esigenza dei suoi ospiti. ci ha dato cartine e indicazioni utili al nostro soggiono. molto comodo il noleggio delle biciclette direttamente da lui: il centro è raggiungibile in 10,15 minuti. daniel è sempre reperibile al telefono per qualsiasi informazione e, quando è in casa, sempre disponibile per due chiacchiere e una birra...  the room is very cosy, with everything you need, and the area of the flat is  quiet and within easy reach from the city center. renting the bikes from daniel is great because  you can start using them as soon as you arrive. daniel is discreet but welcoming, and you can rely on him if you need any updated information regarding what's going on in amsterdam. great stay, indeed.   "
"our stay at daniel's was really, really comfortable and very friendly - as often mentioned: the perfect host! good information in advance made it a breeze to find the location. we had warmly welcome with a can of beer and daniel provided us with lots of useful information (ideas, maps, tipps, how to use public transport, p&r, ...) about amsterdam and made it easy for us to get a good start for our city trip.  he also was always at hand, when we needed some help. the rooms are very clean, you got everything you need for a good stay, and you even can borrow two bikes from daniel. like this, we could experience the city like we were living there - by bike. if we were going there once again, we know where to stay ;)"
daniel is a great host. the apt is clean and in a nice neighborhood. i was able to run in a very nice park a couple of blocks away. you cannot walk down to the tourist part of town from his area but there is a bus close by that will get you there. i recommend daniels airbnb.
"daniel was the perfect host. great instructions on how to get there, and he met me at the door with a big smile. accommodation was immaculately clean, and daniel was attentive to any needs i may have had.  his attention to detail is quite remarkable. along with that, and his thorough knowledge of the area, it was a very enjoyable stay.  thanks daniel."
"i can only say that my stay at daniel's was amazing. his place is clean, it's very nice. the neighborhood's quiet. it's located near transportations and café's. i would definitely come back!"
"daniel is definitely a super host... his house was perfectly clean when we arrived, he gave us all the information to have a great stay in amsterdam. he was always helpful when i needed anything. i also rented his bikes which was really convenient to move around the city. i would certainly recommend this place for a nice stay in amsterdam."
"daniel è una persona estremamente gentile. l'accoglienza è stata molto buona. ci ha fornito mappe della città, indicazioni ed è estremamente disponibile in caso di qualsiasi necessità. la stanza era in perfetto ordine, pulita e profumata e non ci è mancato niente. che dire amsterdam è una bellissima città e per quanto riguarda la nostra esperienza anche le persone sono molto gentili!   il quartiere è carino, servito da mezzi che in pochi minuti ti portano nel centro. infine un'ottima esperienza!!!"
daniel is a fantastic host and so are his cozy quarters. he welcomes you with a beverage and maps with detailed information to make your stay a pleasant one. his home is clean and very well equipped. he makes every effort to keep in touch with you when a question my arise. the nieghborhood is not in the centeral part of amsterdam but public transport is no problem. the nieghborhood is quiet and has nice cafes in the surrounding area. loved my time there. 
daniel was a great host. he welcomed us into his home and gave us a plethora of information about the town and how to get around. he was very available for questions and incredibly nice. we were looking for a relaxing stay so we mostly kept to ourselves and he seemed to respect that as well but i got the idea that he would have been very sociable if that is the kind of stay you are interested in.
"l'accueil est très chaleureux et agréable. daniel est gentil et aux petits soins. la chambre est très propre et bien décorée. on se sent bien chez lui. on se sent en sécurité dans le quartier, tout a été parfait ! je le recommande.    and i love amsterdam. thanks you !"
"daniel nous a très bien accueilli lors de notre séjour. il nous a donner plusieurs idées et moyens pratiques pour nous déplacer, nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce logement, quartier bien situé, ni trop près ni trop loin du centre d'amsterdam ! et accès rapide à vélos, loués directement chez l'hôte, une très bonne expérience! nous le remercions pour ce séjour !"
"das zimmer bzw. die wohnung ist genauso wie beschrieben!   daniel ist sehr angenehm, ein sehr netter gastgeber. er hat uns viele tipps gegeben, war immer sehr hilfsbereit. wenn er nicht persönlich für fragen da war konnten wir ihn mobil erreichen - er meldete sich immer umgehend.  die wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet, alles picobello sauber.  die anbindung mit dem bus bzw. mit der straßenbahn ist super.  falls wir nochmals nach amsterdam fahren, dann wieder zu daniel!"
although i came late he took time from work to meet and to brief me. competent and clean. 
"daniel is the perfect host - warm, welcoming, and helpful. the moment i stepped into his flat, he sat me down, offered me a drink, and then went over amsterdam's public transit system and potential sightseeing suggestions. daniel also made sure to check up on how i am doing throughout my trip - when we had issues communicating by text, he continued to keep in touch via email, which is much appreciated.   the accommodations are as advertised. the room is cosy and looks out on daniel's carefully cultivated garden. the lavatory and bathroom, which are separate, are exceptionally clean. the flat itself has close access to the public transit system should you opt not to ride a bike in amsterdam. all in all, daniel's flat is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in amsterdam. highly recommended."
"i found the facility exactly as it is published. my stay was comfortable. quite room, clean bathroom and i was allowed to use the living. he has really made it to me very easy with explaning everything i needed during my stay in amsterdam. daniel's facility is located very good and one can reach most of the places using the public transportations at any time. i would like to extend my thanks to daniel's person for his kindness, helping me when i need help and caring about me. when i'll be in amsterdam in the future i'll stay at his home. so i'll also recommend everyone of my friends and relatives to go there.  and last but not least; i wish that all air b&b provider can treat their guests as daniel did with me.  "
we had a very pleasant stay with a super friendly host. everything was so clean and the room is super cute! it's about fifteen minutes to amsterdam centrum and the area is good as well.    a plus !!
"wir haben uns bei daniel sehr wohl gefühlt. er ist ein zuvorkommender gastgeber. das zimmer war modern und komfortabel eingerichtet, super für einen kurzen städtetripp. besonders ausgefallen ist die sauberkeit und die tolle organisation von daniel. die anbindung zur innenstadt war angenehm und mit einem tagesticket auch nicht zu teuer. die nachbarschaft ist eher ruhig, es gibt aber alle geschäfte des täglichen bedarfs. wir kommen gerne wieder!"
"loved daniels place....   would stay there again in s heart beat.   good location, well equipped, clean...daniel is very friendly, and informative"
"ottima accoglienza, abbiamo concordato l'orario di arrivo e siamo stati accolti puntualmente. subito abbiamo avuto le istruzioni per i primi movimenti nella città, parcheggio e mezzi pubblici"
"daniels garden view room is a very enjoyable experience. the room was as advertised , very comfortable, and clean. daniel is a very friendly host as he has a plethora of information about the city and is very responsive to email if there need be a problem. even allowed an extra guest on our last nights stay without a charge or compliant. would recommend his place anytime. "
"daniel is a great host. on our arrival he prepared every kind of information for us, there's nothing he doesn't know about amsterdam and even provided us with bikes. he has travelled a lot, it may be very interesting to hear some of his stories : )"
"daniel was a perfect host, offering maps and restaurant suggestions. he was easily accessible by phone and email. his room was spotless and comfortable. would recommend to any traveler who wants an ""off the beaten path"" amsterdam experience :) "
"daniel made me feel very welcome from the very beginning, offering me a drink and a detailed overview of the city. he's a great guy and this apartment is very well decorated and spotless. he definitely has an eye for design. daniel was very helpful. he answered every question i had, gave me extra blankets when i requested them, and even helped me hang my laundry!    the shower and bathroom are wonderful and close to the room you'd be staying at.    this listing is in indische buurt, which is a bit out of the way from everything else, but public transportation is fairly straightforward. the street itself is dark, but there weren't any instances where i felt unsafe. there are a few excellent restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the property.    overall a great value and i really enjoyed my stay here!"
"super gastgeber, feines zimmer, tolle ruhige wohngegend nahe dem zentrum. wir waren ein paar tage zu gast und haben uns mehr als wohl gefühlt. danke schön."
"daniel was such a gracious host. he was there whenever we needed him, and always made sure we had the recourses we needed. the house was so lovely and clean. i would highly recommend staying here. "
"房东招待了我们茶水,并且提供了阿姆斯特丹附近景点的详尽地图,以及办理公共交通或是自行车的租住方式｡房源与描述基本一致｡房源处在阿姆斯特丹安静,安全的街区｡总之,这是一次非常好的体验｡"
"daniel was such a good host. he took everything seriously and we felt really welcomed. he gave us maps, showed us the city and gave some tips. the room was just perfect. really clean, wonderful beds, cozy. i would recommend this room to anyone. it is better to love with daniel then to live in a fine hotel. "
"daniel is a very super human  welcoming, insightful, relevant host. if  i  go to amsterdam  i want to stay his home. thanks for every thinkg :))"
"excelente atencion por parte de daniel, tanto la habitacion como la atencion de daniel excelente, nos hizo sentirnos como en casa.  muchas gracias daniel."
we enjoyed staying at daniels place! it was very clean and organized. daniel was very nice and welcomed us with the the information that we needed. he was a great host and we hope that all will consider staying with him ! 
"if i were going to become an airbnb host, i would template as closely as possible daniel's approach. i like the location, it adds to the experience of feeling local vs tourists. the city is an enjoyable walk and with daniel's map easy tram and bus routes to an from everywhere.  his advice is spot on and as he listens to your interest books magically appear in your room.  the noise from the other residents is non existent.  the design and build obviously intended it this way.  only noise on my stay were the birds outside my windows which if you weren't paying attention, you'd not even notice.  i plan on returning multiple times in the future to daniel's.  "
"daniel's var et godt eksempel på min forestilling om, hvornår et b&b bør fungere. venlig modtagelse, god glidning om byen og seværdigheder. pænt og rent overalt. gode toilet og næstformand. roligt kvarter tæt på transportmuligheder ind til centrum. jeg følte mig meget velkommen. vil helt bestemt vende tilbage, når jeg skal til amsterdam igen. på gensyn daniel "
"daniel è una persona molto socievole , ci siamo trovati molto bene a casa sua , ci ha sempre aiutato in tutto sin dall arrivo fin alla nostra partenza . amsterdam è una bellissima città ma molto caotica , tutta da scoprire ; se si ha un host come daniel niente è impossibile."
"bonjour nous avons été reçu par un hôte intelligent et chaleureux , son logement est à son image bien entretenu sain et confortable -:) très bonne 1 ère expérience air bon !!!"
"i felt very fortunate to stay at daniel's place. the most important thing for me was his place/bldg. neighborhood is quiet. i was well rested for each day's adventure. daniel offered me some suggestions that were highlights of my time, including the keukenhof gardens and the eye film institute where i saw art films that would not be screened in my home town. i relied on his tour map (linking public transportation to main sights) more than my travel guide.  daniel supplied me with electric water heater in my room so i could consume tea/coffee at my leisure, added some of my laundry to his own, showed me how to use (hidden by airbnb) map in real time and supplied me with a lanyard with his phone number (which i never used but was reassuring to have.  "
"accueil très chaleureux. chambre confortable et fonctionnelle. propreté irréprochable. accès facile au réseau de transport en commun. quartier intéressant, très vivant, offrant la plupart des services dont on peut avoir besoin (nombreux cafés, restaurants, supermarchés, boulangeries, etc.)."
"we had the most wonderful experience at daniel's place in amsterdam! not only was the room comfortable, colourful, light, quiet, and equipped with everything we could possibly need - and daniel's flat spotless and beautifully furnished and in a great location - but daniel himself is the perfect host, spending the first hour of our arrival talking to us about amsterdam, answering our many questions, showing us how to get around. we felt immediately comfortable and welcomed, and confident that, during our three day visit, if we had any questions, daniel would be there to help us. indeed, on our first day, he emailed to check we were okay! we can't recommend daniel highly enough!"
"daniel was a great host, very helpful with transportation and checked in frequently to make sure we were having a nice trip. the apartment was very clean. "
"daniel was one of the best hosts i've ever come across! he was friendly, extremely helpful & went the extra mile to make sure my friend and i were at home at his place. daniel's apartment was cosy and extremely clean - i really appreciate how he took pride in the little details, such as allocating space for us to hang our bath towels and clearing our trash every day. it might be a little far to walk to the city centre but we rented bikes from him and also took the bus on the other days so it wasn't a problem.

"très bon accueil de daniel pour notre week-end à amsterdam. endroit propriété, accessible facilement en transport depuis le centre de la ville. daniel a été un hôte de très bons conseils afin d'organiser au mieux notre séjour. n'hésitez pas à loger chez lui!"
"daniel,    gracias y mil  gracias por tu estadía, no pudo ser mejor!!! sin lugar a dudas el mejor bnb en el que estuvimos.  "
daniel was very welcoming and attentive during my stay. the room was charming and quiet. extremely clean. distance to downtown was reasonable with the tram and bus. 
"c'est de loin note meilleur séjour airbnb. daniel est très disponible, accueillant, attentionné et chaleureux. nous avons partagé des bières, petits déjeuners et de nombreuses conversations!  l'appartement est très bien situé, bien desservi par les transports (tram et bus) et très propre."
wir wohnten 3 tage bei daniel und fühlten uns von anfang an wohl in seinem schönen apartment. er konnte uns viele gute tipps bzgl. sehenswürdigkeiten und essen geben und war immer offen für unsere fragen. auch konnten wir gute stadträder bei ihm kostengünstig leihen und direkt die stadt erkunden. werden bei gelegenheit gerne wieder kommen!
"daniel was the perfect host.  very helpful with our stay in amsterdam.  good location, an easy, short bus ride to the centre of town.  the cleanliness of the apartment was exceptional!  highly recommend a stay here."
from the second you walk into daniel's awesome abode your presented with a sense of cleanthiness beyond expectation! i was super lucky to have found daniel as my first airbnb experience but it's a shame to be so spoiled with his hospitality you rarely find genuine chareaterstics as of daniels! he goes above and beyond all expectations. and like i told him myself i look up to such secure cleanthiness and warmth of heart!!
daniel was quick in reply to my initial booking request and provided further information about amsterdam upon approving my request. the apartment was clean and thankfully not up a flight of infamously steep dutch stairs. room was quiet and relatively close to transit. 
"daniel es un excelente host, el apartamento es muy organizado y sobre todo muy limpio. de los mejor airbnb que existen. daniel siempre está presto a lo que se necesite, además de tener una solución para cada cosa durante la estadía. muy buena experiencia."
"daniel was great, very welcoming and helpful (in czech: prostě v pohodě borec). he offered us bikes, a map of amsterdam and suggested what to visit or where to go to a restaurant. the room was relaxing and comfortable."
daniel was extremely helpful during our stay and provided absolutely everything we needed for a great stay in amsterdam. his information and maps he gave us were a huge help. 
una gran opcion para dormir en amsterdam. daniel fue un gran host. muy preocupado por todo.  te entrega mucha informacion de la ciudad. la habitacion y el baño privado muy limpios y ordenados.    es facil llegar al centro por transporte publico. barrio muy tranquilo y seguro. lo recomiendo 100% saludos
"everything was exactly as described in airbnb website. a cozy and clean room, comfortable bed and good safety measures. a very quiet place to sleep and recharge the phone. excellent wifi speed. we found everything in his house was neat and daniel has the eye for perfection and attention to details. very well kept garden at the back of the house, immaculate clean toilet and shower.  daniel gives you plenty of privacy and also is helpful should you need anything. this is a perfect place for someone busy who needs to feel at home after a long day at conference. very informative guide provided by daniel, ideal for first time visitors to amsterdam. very good neighborhood.  we found it an easy walk to the bus stops and tram stops and not far from the bars and restaurant. it is ideal location for us to go to rai and also central via rembrandt square and dam square.  we really enjoyed our stay. thank you daniel."
"这一次的airbnb体验,我真的没法挑剔,于是给了daniel全部五星｡本来他是金牌房东,网上无一评价都超赞,我自己以前住过金牌房东的经历也很不错,于是我对他期待已经很高了,但最后daniel和他的房间还是超出了我的预计!首先,房间非常干净｡主客都是脱鞋进屋,而地板确实一尘不染,让人也不忍破坏这种洁净｡其次,物品整齐有序,一应俱全,质量很好,比如床垫和枕头,比自家的还舒服;他连小音响都准备了,可以连接手机播放音乐｡再有房间设计和装饰风格我很喜欢,整体面积虽不大,但经他的设计,显得宽敞舒适,别具心裁,装饰和椅子都是他从其他国家运回来的,家里到处是植物,生机勃勃｡最后是他特别仔细贴心,他自制了地图和骑行指南,给我们解释时非常耐心,还准备了下午茶招待我们,是个很能聊的人,我最后很遗憾没能跟他交谈更多｡他推荐的景点和餐厅也很棒｡他房内还有很多惊喜,不剧透了,等你们去体验｡i would say daniel and his house is awesome and beyond my expectation (even though i actually had quite high an anticipation), considering its flawless cleanness, elaborate decoration (combine with european and african), well-equipped room and his comprehensive guide, friendly and supportive manner. everything seems perfect and staying in his house really made our journey more memorable. those detailed surprises shall be revealed by the next lucky ones. overall, 100% recommended."

"i rented a bike from daniel, and it was a great way to see the city. the room was quite comfortable, and had plenty of space. daniel was always happy to help out. i had a wonderful time in amsterdam."
"daniel was an outstanding host, he gave clear instructions on how to arrive to the place and gave as suggestions about the city, i would fully recommend this place. he was very organized, clean place and allow us to leave the baggage during day after check out. thanks daniel  "
"we had a lovely time at daniel's, he is so welcoming and answered any questions we may have. the room was perfect to return to after a day in the city centre and i thought the addition of a small table and chairs was great as my friend and i enjoyed playing cards in the evening. overall a fantastic place to stay and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
"we have a wonderful stay in daniel's. daniel is kind and pretty helpful. we enjoy the clean house, cozy room, welcome tea, greeting card, handy map and useful information. it's the my prefect first airbnb experience and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend. thanks daniel."
what an honor staying with one of the first hosts in amsterdam. you can clearly see how much he cares about his guests with how meticulously clean the place is and how he has the place set up. he has thought about the whole guest experience end to end and it seems like he has perfected it over the years.    he was a wonderful host and the place was perfect! 
"la estadia en lo de daniel fue perfecta. nos atendio muy amablemente y la casa estaba super ordenada. la ubicacion es perfecta porque esta cerca del centro, a 10 minutos en bici."
"daniel has been a perfect host, we never had an issue and he was always responsive, even at late night or early in the morning!"
"daniel, our host, was very welcoming. everything in the room was clean and perfectly organised. also he was very helpful towards us and provided us with maps of the city and bus schedule information.   he was very easy to contact if we needed any help "
"daniel was one of the best airbnb hosts i have ever had. he communicated with us prior to and during our visit, providing tips on how to navigate the area and even events happening the weekend we were in amsterdam. immediately upon arrival, he provided us with maps and useful brochures. the apartment was extremely clean and the room looked exactly like the pictures. daniel even let us leave our luggage at the apartment on the day of checkout since our plane was departing later in the evening. would 100% reccomend staying in daniel's home!!!"
"easy: daniel is awesome! so friendly, he help us with everything, he provide a fridge with drinks in the room, maps...... just the best airbnb ever, thanks for everything!!!"
daniel is a perfect host and the house and the room are very nice
daniel is the best host ever!  he gave us any information we could possibly need...and maps!  he is very nice and so is his home.  thanks a lot again!  
"daniel's place was great, and daniel wad very easy-going and helpful."
"daniel nous a reçu comme des princes, nous étions la pour visiter ville et environs.   avant le voyage : un max d'informations, réactifs, précis. vous aurez tout pour trouver appart', train,...  accueil : il prend le temps de recevoir, à l'écoute il est de très bons conseils.  daniel est quelqu'un d'attentionné, de cultivé, qui saura vous mettre à l'aise.   l'appartement est impeccable, tout est ""carré"", propre. à proximité du tramway (14) et bus (22) pour le centre/la gare. à 10' en gros.  possibilité de louer velo, supérette à 100m,...nickel !  daniel nous a même invité à sa table un soir,...que dire, si ce n'est : allez y les yeux fermes !  merci pour tout daniel. "
daniel was an amazing host! his apartment was really nice and clean. love the neighborhood as well. 
"daniel was amazing. the whole trip was great! from offering us a drink (and nibbles!) upon arrival to sending travel tips for trains after we'd left for the airport, and everything in between, he was the perfect host. i had some issues with the bike we rented from him (i'm very short!!!) and he had got his tools out and adjusted the bike for me before i had even woken up on day 2. just brilliant. also, the house was impeccably clean!! a lovely, friendly and very easy-to-talk to man. thank you so much, daniel :) "
daniel was an absolutely fantastic host. the first day he welcomed us in and provided information and suggestions on things to do around the city. i would highly recommend staying with daniel for anyone traveling to amsterdam.
"很幸运能在旺季订到daniel家一周,超乎想象的好,安全､安静､整洁,房东热情得恰到好处,房间里有你可能用到的一切,有热水壶哟~暖气温度成迷,有的时候夜里没有会觉得冷,和房东说就好啦,不习惯光脚记得带双拖鞋｡沟通邮件里的很多信息都非常有用,省去很多自己找攻略的时间｡从国内去的话不用怕退订严格,荷兰签证很好办的,一天出签给了一年多次,放心订吧,再也找不到性价比这么好的房子了!位置不算偏,阿姆超级小,这要在北京还算二环以里呢……附近四个方向都有公交去到各个区｡daniel实在太贴心啦,听说我要吃蘑菇还非常严肃地讲了注意事项,让我在家里试注意安全｡我自己带了小礼物去,走前还收到了回礼,大家也可以带点自己那里特产过去,他连凤爪都觉得好吃呢接受度可高了哈哈哈~"
"daniel is warm, welcoming and extremely helpful. he did everything he could before and after arrival to make sure we were comfortable. this included maps, and instructions along with things we could see and do and how to get there. i would recommend daniel to anyone. "
"everything is great, thank you, daniel!"
"daniel is the perfect host! very nice, is very flexible and thoughtful. gives all the information that tou need to walk/ride around town!  the house is in a quiet area but near the center. if i come back to amesterdam i hope that daniel house is free!"
"daniel warmly welcomed me and provided travel books, information a map  with locations of tourist spots and the number and type of transport to use. he kindly organised an ""e"" ticket for me and was very approachable to my needs and requests. the apartment was very clean and i appreciated his welcoming note and vase of tulips. i felt comfortable  as a mature person travelling alone in this neighbourhood which is walking distance to restaurants, laundrettes and a supermarket. daniel is great host.  karlene from melbourne australia"
daniel is a great host and very arranging. everything was really clean and the location is nice (very close to downtown by tramway or bus) i definitely recommend it if you want to spend quality time in amsterdam and have nice tips. 
"daniel es un excelente anfitrión, lo recomendamos totalmente. cerca del bus y una zona muy tranquila. te sentís como en casa."
"daniel is an extremely pleasant person - an experienced traveller  himself. his room and service area (bathroom and toilets) are probably  the cleaner on thus planet- i really plan to indicate his name for the nobel prize, if the sweddish academy opens an airb&b competition... serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. the mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (i never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). we had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. in two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  if you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (daniel will provide you if required). in summary - enjoy his room because amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. daniel is a privileged man..."
"房主daniel本人非常注意卫生,所以房间很干净,设备也很齐全｡ 另外,房主对于安全非常重视,在房子里设置了警铃,不过,阿姆斯特丹这么安全,根本不需要这些东西嘛,哈哈"
"daniel's place is a little away from centraal but is in a quiet and well connected locality. he's a very nice host and his place is absolutely and spotlessly clean (cleaner than hotels!). like the previous travelers, we too, found the beds in the room to be supremely comfortable! he was extremely meticulous and thorough and the directions he gave us to arrive at his house and also go about the city were very detailed and extremely helpful.  the house is close to both bus and tram stops and the locality also seemed safe late at night. there are also a couple of restaurants and local bars around.  we had a lovely stay. "
un lugar agradable para sentirse como en casa. daniel es muy atento y está pendiente de todo para que te encuentres a gusto. aunque no esta en el centro está muy bien comunicado y el paseo desde la casa al centro es muy agradable.  es un barrio tranquilo. la casa es muy acogedora y nos sentimos muy cómodos. si volvemos a amsterdam desde luego iremos a casa de daniel.
trop loin du centre par conséquent relativement compliqué d'accéder au centre ville
非常好!!!离火车站不远的坐22路公交车可以直达!而且房子超级干净 daniel人也很棒 我们去羊角村一天他会让我们把行李放在家里寄存一天! 很安全 有报警器｡ 总之 去阿姆斯特丹就住这吧
it's exactly how it's previewed online  he is very welcoming  helpful  accommodating  he provides great service it is located by great restaurants bars shops cafes  all in all me and my mom loved being here  
"room: cozy and comfortable, a calming beautiful window view of a garden. apartment: beautiful interior & relaxing, feels like home! neighborhood: quiet and pleasant, a bit away from the city center but you get to visit lots of cafe's and restaurant around aswell. host: daniel was very accomodating, has prepared everything you will need for your stay in the city, you get to have great and fun conversations with him, you will be for sure well taken care of! a great person, so far the best experience i had having a such a host! thank you again!!!"
daniel was an incredible host and everything was exactly as described and pictured. daniel went out of his way to make sure our stay at his apartment was amazing! thanks so much! 
"ha sido una estancia genial. daniel nos recibió con toda la amabilidad y la información necesaria para tener unas increibles vacaciones. daniel es un chico muy atento y lo tiene todo impecable, así como se muestra dispuesto a ayudar en todo momento."
the house is beautiful and balanced. the room is nice and quiet. grear stay with daniel!
good option for solo travellers. quiet neighbourhood with many options to reach city centre. very clean rooms and a helpful host.
daniel is the perfect host. such a lovely guy.  so helpful and knowledgeable about the city and how to get to everywhere you want to enjoy. very central and so easy to get around. great recommendations for food and drink.  he has a spotless home and the room is very comfortable with everything you need. super host indeed!
"daniel was the perfect host! when we arrived, he welcomed us and explained everything concerning the apartment and the area we lived in. his apartment is beautifully furnited, it was very clean, the beds were very comfortable. he gave us advice on sightseeing and restaurants. we very much enjoyed our stay there and would stay with him again anytime!"
"daniel is super nice and helpful. his place is exactly the same as pictures, clean, neat and cozy. it's a bit away from city center, but i like its quiet and with bus u are convenient to go everywhere. if u are interested in his place please don't hesitate for booking :)"
"daniel as a host was absolutely outstanding and exceptional. upon arrival, he gave us a quick  tour of his place and it was incredibly clean and provided us with everything we needed and more. in fact, he left us with great guides on amsterdam and info on how to get where we wanted. location wise, his place is great, as everything we wanted to get to was within walking distance and close to the heart of amsterdam.  as a host, i can't commend him enough. any time we had a question, daniel was more than willing to go out of his way to provide us with information about amsterdam and was a tremendous help! i send infinite thanks to him for his outstanding hospitality and for letting us stay near the heart of amsterdam for an absolutely great price!!"
"i've stayed in many airbnb places, from the best to the worst, and i'm a host myself. i can honestly say that i've never met a host who went so far out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of. daniel knows his city and is happy to share his knowledge -- not in an overbearing way, but with a thoughtful, light touch."
"daniel is a perfect host: he is really kind, precise and accurate; he gave us a lot of useful information and he is always available to answer to guests' questions. room is in a quiet district, well linked to the center with public transport."
"daniel well deserves his rating as a superhost!  he is gracious, helpful, thoughtful and a pleasure to talk with.  his place was lovely, even more so in person than in photos.  it was located in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood in eastern part of amsterdam.  a short walk from a number of restaurants and café.  easy access to public transportation which will take you into central part of city in 15 minutes.  our 4 nights stay here were delightful and will stay again in a heartbeat!"
excelente anfitrión siempre dispuesto a ayudarnos durante nuestra estancia en amsterdam
a model host. a model apartment. airbnb private rooms just don't get any better than this!
come and enjoy
"荷兰的房价和物价普遍有点贵､尤其是接近市中心的｡但是daniel是个特别认真可爱的房东,与他同住你不会任何的拘束,并且地理位置很不错:到市中心和火车站都有直达的公交｡而且房间布置和设施也都很贴心｡期间不小心发烧也得到daniel热情的帮助｡非常感谢~"
to me daniel is the definition of superhost.  his place is very well organized and spotlessly clean. the room is comfortable and has thoughtful amenities. daniel gave me useful information both on practical things and on places to go. i can certainly recommend!
"daniel was a great host! he gave us great tips for transportation and local shops and restaurants, and his place was very clean."
"i had to cancel my trip to amsterdam so unfortunately, i didn't get to stay with daniel. i got very sick the day before i was due to go and couldn't leave home. i still wanted to tell the world that daniel has been so gracious and kind in negotiating refunds under these extenuating circumstances. thank you so much! i hope to rebook and stay with him later this year!"
"great spot just outside downtown. quiet, local, clean. plenty of local cafes nearby to get breakfast lunch or dinner. daniel is amazing host who i would highly recommend!"
"hätte es einen pool gehabt und ein jacuzzi, dann wäre der aufenthalt perfekt gewesen, aber auch so absolut lohnenswert, sehr aufmerksam und freundlich, ruhig, nahe zentrum gelegen, einfach top !"
"this was the second time that i was at daniel's airbnb. just like the previous time everything was very well organized,  accurate, and spotlessly clean. it was again a very comfortable stay. communication on check-in, practicalities, and such goes very easy.  and it is simply nice talking to daniel. i hope to stay there again."
we loved our stay with daniel.  he was very welcoming and helpful.  our room and bathroom were very clean and stylish. we definitely recommend it
daniel is a spectacular host. everything was planned out for us ahead of time and thoughtfully placed. really enjoyed the stay.
this will be your favourite airbnb in amsterdam
"daniel was a great host, he added little touches to make us feel welcome including detailed maps, guidebooks, coffee etc. he even cleaned our used mugs/cups! the room is perfect for one solo traveler or two, albeit a bit tight.  great if you’re looking for a place to sleep/shower and the neighborhood is so cute and peaceful. "
daniel's apartment is very accessible via tram and is close to javaplein where you can get some good breakfast and snacking options. apartment was very clean and room had a lot of small amenities making things easier.he also had a hair dryer :). daniel is a very warm person and gave us a lot of info on our checkin.
daniel goes above and beyond a typical host to make sure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay. easy access to public transportation and some nice restaurants in walking distance made this a perfect place to stay during my recent trip. 
daniel's apartment is very pleasant and comfortable. it is located not far from the center. daniel helped us alot and gave some tips to make our visit great. thank you daniel!
daniel is a great host
"a neat room in a downstairs home, with shower and bathroom in the hallway. daniel makes it feel like a hotel room, and you get your own key to enter the house."
"daniel is a wonderful host. he is very responsive and easy to talk to. the accommodation is out of the city center, which is both good and bad. a 15-minute tram ride will get you to the city center no problem, though. daniel also makes it very easy to understand how to get around as well. it is clear daniel has thought everything through when it comes to accommodations, and if you like a quieter, more residential neighborhood, i would suggest staying here. "
"getting in touch and check-in/-out very uncomplicated. quiet neighborhood, close to tram and bus stations. room and bathroom very clean. daniel makes you feel at home and provides a lot of information you might be interested in as tourist and even looks stuff up for you in the internet. would totally recommend. "
daniel so nice and gave us many advices. we loved our stay in daniel’s place. the location is in a very quiet area and very close from transportation.
daniel's place was amazing .  his place is spotless and he provides so much information and nice touches.
"a great host, and helpful about how to get around as well."
daniel was an amazing host. highly recommend staying with him.
daniel went above and beyond with his hospitality and helpfulness. the place is meticulously crafted to fit almost any need a guest could have. couldn't recommend daniel and his place enough.
"we had a great stay in daniel’s house. we enjoyed it so much and the situation was great. daniel rent us two bikes and we enjoyed it. he was very friendli and showed us how to get to the city and gave us some books and printed some maps from amsterdam. thank you so much daniel, we had a great trip in amsterdam!"
nice place
"daniel is a great host and the place is incredibly clean and organised. daniel can tell you the best ways to get around, there's quick buses to amsterdam central all the time and a tram too. great local restaurants and bars too. we had a fantastic time!"
"daniel was so welcoming. i came in a little later than i thought i was going to but daniel was very understanding. he has so much information at your disposal, from tram lines and the stops you can get off to tons of information guides. i also had laundry i needed to get done and he was so helpful in getting it done. i would definitely recommend staying here."
daniel could open a 5 star hotel. our stay provided everything we needed to be comfortable and happy.
"this is an outstanding place to stay. everything is spotless but very comfortable. it’s in a quiet neighborhood outside of the bustling downtown, but a close 15 minutes by tram. daniel went out of his way to be helpful with directions and things to do. he even sent me a note on our first day asking if we were having a good time. i highly recommend this airbnb and would definitely stay here again."
daniel’s place was great! the room was close to downtown and very clean. daniel is kind and accommodating and gave us great recommendations and tips for our trip to amsterdam. i highly recommend this location!
"the location of sasha's b&b makes it ideal for short amsterdam visits; everything you might want to see is walkable.     we stayed in the smallest room of the building, which was o.k. for the one night we spent. our room was neat and clean, as was the bathroom. if you travel with more luggage and want to stay longer, make sure to book a bigger room. unfortunately, on the site it's not quite clear how to choose the room you'll be staying in.    "
"the room was much smaller than in the picture, was filled with mosquitos and was very hot. however, the host was friendly and let us check in an hour early, as well as let us use another rooms shower when our room wasn't ready yet."
"the place was much better than i thought. very nice room and the host was very friendly. actually i didn't make too much use of the room, just came back to collect my luggage. i guess that's amsterdam, :-)."
"la camera non era quella delle foto, ma nel complesso era molto carina ed accogliente con vista sulla strada principale.  purtroppo il nostro problema più grande è che abbiamo avuto la visita di un piccolo topo di città sotto il letto una delle sere in camera. la pulizia era buona, e il propietario è stato premuroso e disponibile in piena notte per aiutarci a risolvere il problema. in ogni caso credo che sia giusto comunicarlo qui, se pur spero che l'episodio non si ripresenti più...  il bagno e molto piccolo e non ha riscaldamento, in più la piccola finestra è sempre aperta quindi fare la doccia ci è rimasto un pò complicato perchè faceva davvero molto freddo.  la posizione è senz'altro ottima poichè permette di raggiungere ogni attrazione a piedi senza utilizzare i costosissimi trasporti pubblici. coffee shop, ristoranti italiani e argentini, souvenir, cinema e casinò nelle vicinanze."
"alex was a wonderful host, very nice. the room was cozy, great if you're just looking to spend a weekend in amsterdam because the location is close to everything! "
the reservation was canceled 52 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
the reservation was canceled 58 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
"my stay at alex's apartment was everything i needed it to be! the room was in a great location, close enough to walk to all the main attractions. the room was fairly small however the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. the only thing bad about the room was that it was situated on a main road and the traffic noise was very loud throughout the night. other than that, had a pleasant stay. thanks alex! "
"il soggiorno trascorso in questa stanza è stato delizioso, l'ambiente é piccolo ma ci si muove bene, il bagno è condiviso ma nella privacy e discrezione totale. il proprietario ci ha dotato di tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno, asciugamani e lenzuola pulite, saponi, phon e tv in camera e sopratutto il wi-fi. è in pieno centro, a un passo da tutte le cose più importanti da vedere in città e per gli spostamenti ha la fermata del tram sotto casa. è il posto ideale per vivere un week-end romantico o con  amici ad amsterdam! lo consiglio a tutti per l' ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo!!"
"the room is really cosy and just in the middle of everything. loved the location. good shower and comfortable bed. alex told us everything we needed to know when we arrived. thank you for an excellent stay, alex. we loved amsterdam!"
"really good room, just on the top of a small breakfast restaurant ! perfectly located, just next to the foam - we went there at the opening - and the flower market... alex left guides for us and really welcoming. thank you !"
"the room is nice and in a very centric neighborhood. the bathroom is small but clean and functional. the room is really cosy and just in the middle of everything. loved the location. alex told us everything we needed to know when we arrived. thank you for an excellent stay, alex."
"the room is nice and in a very centric neighborhood. the bathroom is small but clean and functional. however this is not an ""airbnb"" sharing experience, we only saw alex for 5 minutes when checked in so it's more of a hotel than a local house. anyway we had a nice time there and can not complain aboout the service. thanks alex."
"alugar um quarto com o alex foi uma ótima experiência.   o local é muito perto do centro de amsterdam e de todas as outras coisas necessárias.   alex nos recebeu no horário combinado, nos mostrou o quarto, explicou tudo o que era necessário e nos deu um mapa da cidade.  se voltar em amsterdam, com certeza ficarei novamente em um dos quartos do alex. "
"awesome location in amsterdam's city centre. walking distance from every location, we did not use the tram in our whole stay.  the room is very comfortable and though it is in the city centre, at night you hear almost nothing from the outside."
"the place is at a good location, near to the center.  the room was nice and quiet.  it has sturdy, hardwood floors, two locks for entry.  one lock is the main entrance, the other is for the room.  you get a key for both locks.    two power strips for charging and other electrical needs.  hangers and shelves to keep your clothes nice.  flat screen monitor with remote control for entertainment.    the bed was very comfortable and kept me very warm through the cold night.    i would definitely stay here again.  "
"alex is a kind man who described us everything and gave us some tips.the room is in a great spot of amsterdam with many bars and restaurants around. we assumed a nice, comfortable and clean room and our expectations have been fulfilled! the only negative point: the café at the ground floor started playing music at 6.30 in the morning. "
"i'd recommend this place! great location, great price. the room was clean and in a central location. also very close to the tram that takes you to central station.     there are small/steep stairs up to the room. this was not a problem for us, but good to know for other travelers!     the bathroom is connected to the room, but is not heated. once you turn the hot water on, you are fine (but something to keep in mind for traveling during the winter). "
"the place was very close to the center, accessible by foot, we really enjoyed this proximity! it was clean and the bed was good. the bathroom was a little cold but during winter it's not that surprising. the breakfast place in the same building was perfect. it's pretty much like a hotel room. "
"unfortunately i was not met at the place when i arrived and started to get a bit worried. the receptionist in the hotel next door fortunately found his phone number and he explained that he had to go to hospital at short notice and a friend would let me in soon which he did.    but a comfy night after i asked for the heating to be put on,which seemed to be missing the second night.(which came on early next morning)"
"bien placé, propre et hôte accueillant. a recommander!"
"happy with the room, it was nice. would stay there again no problem. "
"vor ort unkompliziert und der beschreibung entsprechend, zuvor der mailkontakt etwas anstrengend, um die genaue adresse zu bekommen. stellte aber als unbegründet heraus."
"alex was welcomed,room was clean   great location "
"belle chambre, dans le centre ville, hôte accueillant, que demander de plus ?"
"we stayed here for two nights, everything is clean and tidy. alex is a nice guy, we found a city map and the explanations were ok. i'd recommend this place"
"very nice and cozy place,very clean. and near the tram station and the central"
"bella camera con bagno privato al secondo piano di questo palazzo classico di amsterdam, vicinissima al mercato dei fiori. alex è stato un pochino insistente per sapere l'ora esatta del check-in, e purtroppo noi abbiamo ritardato di un paio d'ora sulle nostre tabelle di marcia, avvisandolo ma sentendoci quasi sgridati. consigliato, ma occhio ad avvisarlo sull'ora d'arrivo!"
"alex met us at the expected time in the apartment and gave us good directions and also nice recommendations for dinner. the  studio is centrally located, attraktions in walking distance, very clean and quiet although the tram stops in front of the house. the bathroom is a bit small, but okay. we enjoyed our stay and will come back."
"great place, great location to stay . "
"alex was very friendly. the room was super clean and decent. great location, everything is nearby and you don't need public transport."
"la camera rispecchia esattamente quanto descritto. il bagno è un po' piccolo, ma in ogni caso funzionale. la camera era pulita, e la posizione dello stabile a due passi dal centro, comodissima sia di giorno che di notte e adiacente ad un ottimo bar dove fare colazione con un buon caffè espresso.  alex è stato molto gentile e disponibile.  consigliato per visite brevi, in quanto tutti gli extra (lenzuola ed asciugamani puliti) hanno costi aggiuntivi per permanenze inferiori ai 7 giorni."
"the room is very clean, bed is super comfortable and the duvet is very soft. alex met me on time, helped me get acquainted with the space and then gave me a lot of privacy. the flat is in a great locations, close to many nice restaurants and for walking around the centre. i would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting amsterdam."
"great price and location.  good bed, no street noise, good water pressure and hot water, shower is small.  surprised how quiet the neighborhood was at night, but it was monday.  steep stairs, narrow steps.  best for the young and agile."
our stay in amsterdam couldn't be better than this one. the room is very confortable and close to everything touristic. just pretty good and amazing.
the place is well located and the room is clean.the wifii didnt work properly on our iphones but thats pretty much the only thing we have to say.i would recommand this place.
"we had a very warm welcome with detailed directions from alex, and he availed himself to answer all our questions. the room was lovely and had everything we needed and the best part was the location, the tram stop is right outside! i would recommend this to fellow travellers. thank you alex for a lovely stay in amsterdam, we really had an unforgettable time."
"our stay was great! the room is beautiful and is in a great location. alex was there to meet us with the keys and answer any questions we had. if i find myself back in amsterdam, i would definitely stay again. the wifi didn't work very well but other than that, not a complaint to be had!"
"great location, clean room, comfy bed. thank you alex!"
"my boyfriend and i stayed at alex's apartment for 2 nights. we were due to arrive at 1.30pm, however missed our flight so didn't arrive until 3.15pm. when i messaged alex that morning to explain that we would be a couple of hours late because of a missed flight, i got the reply 'well thanks for ruining my plans!!!!!' while i could understand us being late would be annoying for him, this was not a very nice response.  however, once we did get there, we really enjoyed our stay at the apartment! the bedroom was big, the bed was super comfortable, and the place was very clean. it was in a great location-central, with a tram station right outside if needed. alex included a map and some touristy information when checking in. the wifi didn't work very well, but the rest of the apartment made up for it. we would recommend this airbnb.   "
alex was an excellent host. he greeted us and gave us a quick overview of rules and things we needed to know about our location.  alex was excellent with communication and always responded my texts promptly. the house is centrally located and very convenient. he was wonderful as my first airbnb experience and i would absolutely stay with him again.  
the room is at a great location and very easy to get to from central station. we enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend. 
"alex's house is extremely central and the bed is the highlight of the rooms, extremely comfortable. alex accommodated our request for evening check-in and provided maps and tourist information for the city. however, the wi-fi signal is weak and could be strengthened and the stairwell to the rooms is steep, narrow and has low headroom.  knowing this, i would stay here again and recommend it to friends."
"beautiful flat in amsterdam! it was the perfect location. alex was there to greet us and was very helpful. the internet was slow, but overall i would definitely recommend this flat. "
"alex was a lovely host. the location is excellent, walking distance to many attractions. we really enjoyed our stay."
"alex's place was in a great location, walking distance from everywhere. the apartment was very nicely furnished and quiet despite being on a main road. we enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others! "
"central location - walking distance to almost everything!   there is a bar fridge however there isn't any kitchen facilities or bowls/cutlery etc so this is only really useful if you wanted to keep drinks cold etc unless you bring your own utensils. we ate breakfast down stairs at the local cafe as we were told we would get a special discount if we mentioned we were staying with alex - for two breakfasts we only got a 1 euro discount that, for a 28 euro bill, wasn't that much in the scheme of things. i would recommend exploring elsewhere as we found you could get much cheaper breakfasts at other cafes around amsterdam. however, this cafe wasn't bad and the coffee was yum. the room was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. alex gave us a quick run down of everything on the first day and then was never to be seen again which, to be honest, was nice as it felt like we weren't sharing with anyone! it's like a studio apartment minus the kitchen and laundry! overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you alex."
"the room was pleasant and clean. bed was comfortable. location was very good and central to site seeing in amsterdam. however it was on a main road so we could hear the road with the window open.   shower was good temperature and easy to use, however just be aware the bathroom itself is very very small (a larger sized person might struggle)  meant to meet alex at 12, we arrived few minutes early,  rang the doorbell and continued to ring it intermittently over the next 30 minutes.  he did not respond and we had to ask the hotel next door to use the wifi so we could contact him. we were waiting outside in the rain and when he opened the door, he didn't seem very apologetic and made a comment that because we arrived early he wasn't to hear the doorbell.he didn't offer to help with our bags,  and again for anyone considering this air bnb should be aware the stairs are spiralling, narrow and steep. once in the room, he went through information with us and was very quick to get the city tax from us and ask when we would check out. he did ask us if we had any more questions and gave us the opportunity to ask however because of how.our interaction begun,  we felt we couldn't really ask. overall i would not rate this place for hosting skills to enhance your experience when visiting amsterdam as we found it very transactional and impersonal and as if we were a burden however the room itself is perfectly pleasant and good if your just looking for a place to stay."
we had a marvelous stay in amsterdam and a nice room. the location is perfect and it's easy to reach all important and less important sightseeing places. however please keep in mind the room is located next to a big street with its typical traffic and noise. nevertheless we enjoyed our stay! thank you!
the location of this apartment is perfect. walkable distance to everything and we loved the bakery below. alex was extremely nice and helpful. the place was very modern and clean. we highly recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam.
"tres bon sejour a amsterdam  chambre tres bien située , propre et bien équipée . lit tres confortable  hôte ponctuel et pas dérangeant  a recommander "
"a  cheerful welcome from alex, information about getting around the city and quick tour of the dos and don'ts. the room and ensuite are great and the traffic noise no problem.  don't be put off by an apartment close to the centre; amsterdam is a wonderfully compact, clean and friendly city with millions of clean, quiet bicycles. pretty much everyone speaks english (and they aren't offended if you don't speak dutch) and are incredibly helpful.  you can hire a bike, but the combination of :  millions of others, other side of the road, an unfamiliar bike and maybe a beer or two is not likely to be relaxing. the city is small enough to explore on foot or buy a day ticket for the brilliant public transport system.  have fun, nigel"
this place was fantastic. walking distance from everything you'd want to visit in amsterdam! alex was very efficient and helpful. would stay here again ! 
"the room is exactly as pictured, a small but bright and comfortable room.  do note that the bathroom is quite small but manageable.  alex's friend met us to check in and was at least 30 minutes late.  that being said, alex was easily reachable by phone and resolved the situation.  the bed was very comfortable and we had a great stay in this place.  would stay again and would highly recommend!"
"the host turned up on time to hand over the keys and explain a few things. the location is very central. the noise is not too bad considering it is on one of the main streets with trams. towels, shampoo and soap were provided."
the studio is exactly as described. alex was there to give us the keys and explain everything. the bathroom is very small but it's alright for a short stay. my friend and i really enjoyed staying there and i would recommend this place to everyone who plans a short stay in amsterdam and wants to live central.
"we really enjoyed our stay here. everything was as promised. it is close to all the main attractions and we found we walked everywhere during our three night stay. it is approx 5-10mins walk to dam square. the room is roomy, well furnished, and had good security having to enter through two lockable doors. the bed is very comfortable, not to soft but not rock hard either. it has a cosy shower and toilet that is your own. there was little to no noise during the day or night. alex was friendly and provided us with the information we needed. next time we visit amsterdam we will definitely be staying here. great work alex. stayed as a couple from sydney australia."
"lovely room, great location. the bed was really comfortable and room very spacious. shower was  nice and hot. five minutes walk to shops and restaurants. only thing would say negatively is that the room lighting is very dim so we found it difficult to get ready in the evening, and the internet signal was not great."
"alex is very nice, helpful, and informative. the room was nice and cozy. it was very quiet and peaceful. there is a coffee shop below, which is very convenient. everything is walking distance and the tram stops right in front of the house. the only thing was we heavily relayed on wifi, but the signal was very low and you would only get wifi in certain areas of the room."
"really loved amsterdam and the apartment made it all the more enjoyable for us. it's very centrally located, so we didn't use transport once other than to and from the station. it was clean, and spacious. the bathroom is slightly small, but we knew that up front and it didn't make the stay unbearable at all. alex accommodated us with an early check in for no additional costs and was easily accessible throughout our stay. he was very welcoming and forthcoming with information about amsterdam to make our stay better! thanks for an amazing experience alex."
"myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights and it was ideal. the location meant we could walk everywhere around the city although the metro did stop right outside. lovely, clean apartment. would definitely recommend staying here. "
"i enjoyed the stay at alex's place. the room was clean, smart and well presented. handy for central amsterdam, and handy for breakfast.. alex was very accommodating even when i ended up running late to meet him. will most likely use the room again."
"la habitacion es tal cual se muestra en la foto. con un baño pequeño. esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de todo. en una avenida muy transitada con lugares lindos para pasear y comer. alex nos explico todo y fue muy amable. recomendamos."
"alex' s place is in an ideal location for a visit to amsterdam because of the great central location,   alex was very helpful in accommodating my daughter and her boyfriend on their first trip away on their own and the security of the property helped to make them feel safe and very comfortable  highly recommended "
"the listing was as described; simple and clean, w windows that were able to block out the noise from below. we were located close to many of the more important sites amsterdam, but i think staying in a quieter and less touristy spot may have be preferable.    alex was rather unpleasant to work with. he wanted to know the ""exact"" time we would be arriving in amsterdam, which can be somewhat difficult when traveling.  he seemed agitated and rushed, and his entire demeanor left us w an unpleasant feel for our surroundings. "
"alex was a gracious host and the room is just as the picture. the location is fantastic, close to everything and the city is very easy to navigate. alex was also very helpful with suggestions! "
"the apartment is in a great location and is perfect for a city break on a budget. alex was very friendly and welcoming despite the fact we were late for check-in (air bnb's map led us slightly astray for finding the door - it's further from the corner than the map suggests but is clearly  numbered, we were just being a bit absent minded)."
"alex was extremely welcoming, waiting up for us due to our late arriving flight. when we did finally arrive, he showed us our room, explained how everything worked and gave us a map of amsterdam, telling us where the best places to go were. he was very helpful!"
"my boyfriend and i had a lovely stay at alex's. even though we arrived early, alex was very welcoming and was happy to show us around our room. we were given a map and showed the best places  to visit/eat and alex even gave us an adapter because we forgot to bring our own. this apartment is very conveniently located, we walked everywhere and only got a tram once from the station when we first arrived. the bed was extremely comfy and the shower was really good too. alex even put up a little christmas tree which made the room look even nicer. we would definitely stay here again if we returned to amsterdam! :)"
"this room is perfect for a short stay in amsterdam. great location in the city center, nice quarter, quiet and safe. the room was very comfortable, warm and welcoming. alex has been a very nice host. i definitely recommend this place. "
"alex was very welcoming and helpful. the room is in a great location, it has a cafe underneath which is ideal for breakfast. the room was amazing, exactly what the pictures looked like. bed was really comfortable and nice bedding. room is perfect for a short break to amsterdam!"
"the flat is at a very convenient location, in walking distance to many attractions as well as the city centre, and if you feel like taking the tram there is a station right in front of the building, which was practical on the way from and to the train station, with the luggages. i was arriving early and alex was nice enough to let me check in earlier. the private bathroom is a plus, it's a small one but there's nothing too inconvenient, especially for a short stay. there's a small fridge in the room as well, and everything was clean and neat. the apartment is on one of the main streets but the room was impressingly quiet at night. "
"accomodation true to the description and photos - very nice interior, if windows closed - very silent and can't hear any street noise. very central as well - everything seemed a walk away and we saw a lot of amsterdam by foot. bedding super comfortable ! alex was very friendly and ready to help ! the little café downstairs is a nice plus. thank you for the wonderful long weekend."
my wife and i stayed 2 nights at alex's listing and the location was amazing barely a 5 minute walk from the centre of amsterdam. our train arrived late which i feel terrible about holding alex up but he was lovely and very understanding he gave us a run down of how things worked and left us be. the room was huge and bed was amazingly comfortable. would stay again in a heart beat and highly recommend.
"alex was welcoming and helpful. the room was just as we expected and in a great location in amsterdam in the middle of all the main attractions, nothing was too far. would definitely stay here again if i returned to amsterdam. thanks alex x "
this was a cosy place in an excellent location. enjoyed being able to walk everywhere we needed and the bed was very comfortable. only little issue was the 5% city tax at the start which we weren't aware of as its not on the listing but it was a small fee and we let alex know to clarify for next time. other than that it was a nice little convenient space. 
"by far the best lodging experience i have ever had! all the reviews before me about alex and the place was right on. the location of the place is great, short walking distance to amsterdam's flower market and on the major trams way. alex was very professional, explanatory from the beginning i contacted him and during my stay. the room was exactly how it was described in the pictures and extremely clean. i would definitely stay there if i go back to amsterdam again. thanks again to alex and airbnb for helping with my stay!"
"the room looks exactly like the photos, the bed is very comfortable and big. perfect location, you can walk everywhere."
the room was like the photos! very clean and big enough for two persons. perfect location you have all around the room without take any transport. we would definitely stay there if we go back to amsterdam again. thanks alex!
thanks for a fantastic few days. the apartment was very clean and beautifully furnished. great location with everything in walking distance. alex was very helpful and flexible. would definitely recommend for a short break in amsterdam!  
"the location of the room is very good. and the space of the room was quite big. but the bathroom is very small and cold. also, the communication was not very pleasant. i've been living in 10+ airbnb and this host is by far the worst one. he seems to be impatient about answering my questions and explaining things in detail."
"we stayed one night on a layover.    alex was friendly and easy to get in touch with. he waited for us at the apartment, talked us through various things such as using the shower, the keys, and other things, and left us to explore the city. as we were in amsterdam for only one night, we didn't need to get in touch with him a lot, but for those few times that we had to talk to him, he promptly responded by text.    in general, the room was comfortable. the bed was great, and, although we didn't need to use it, it was good to know that we had access to a mini-fridge.     our only concern was the bathroom. the toilet seat was located so high that it wasn't very comfortable to use. my girlfriend's feet, for instance, could not reach the floor when she was sitting down. we didn't mind this problem too much because we stayed at the room for such a short amount of time, but someone who stays there longer might find the toilet to cause them more discomfort.    so, while i would recommend this place for a short visit to amsterdam, i don't know if one would find it comfortable to deal with the bathroom on a longer trip."
"loved everything about alex's place! excellent communication, perfect location and everything was clean and comfortable. would definitely recommend staying here if you are in amsterdam!"
just like the photos. very well located and perfectly clean. perfect to stay a couple of days in amsterdam.
"absolutely loved our stay here. perfect location, everything's within walking distance. the room was just like the photos, very cosy and the bed was comfortable. it's above a nice little cafe too - the hallway always smelled of coffee. alex met us when we arrived and was really helpful in talking us through everything. will most likely stay here again in the future. "
"the room was identically like the pictures. the location couldn't be better. no need for public transport, everything is in walking distance. alex gave us a quick tour, a map and showed us the main areas to visit. there's also a little café underneath the room where you can have breakfast. we had a nice time!  "
"the room was very nice and clean (exactly as it looks on all the pictures). centrally located, which was a huge plus! small downsides of the room were the not so very strong wifi connection, not being able to store or luggage after check-out, and the cold bathroom. alex also wasn't there when we checked out, and he never answerred on the text message we sent when we left. therefore we had to assume everything was okay. even though there was no possibility of storing our luggage for the rest of the day after we checked out, alex suggested we asked to store it at the cafe on the ground floor right under the room. it was a really cosy cafe where we had a coffee, smoothie and breakfast and the lady was kind enough to store our bags until closing time. if i go back to amsterdam, i would definitely consider going back to this airbnb! "
"we didn't have the opportunity to meet alex. it was his friend coming to meet us. the room was great, good location, clean and spacious. highly recommended."
"a cosy apartment in close distance to everything the centre of amsterdam has to offer: a stones throw away from the flower market and museum quarter.   the bed is super comfortable, and the room is decorated to a high standard. the fridge is a welcome addition, perfect for storing drinks and a few goodies.   alex was a great host, and very accommodating. he provided us with a map and orientated us as well as giving us tips on where to go. although we didn't need him, it's great to know he's available to answer queries 24/7. thank you alex!   in amsterdam, it's worth visiting the artis zoo. we also discovered the dutch resistance museum close by the zoo, which provides a poignant insight into amsterdam in world war 2- a must to visit.    the only downside was the small bathroom: the toilet is a little high for those challenged with height, and the shower a little small. this didn't impact our time at all, and being on a short break meant the bathroom was not of massive concern.   finally, have euros prepared for the tourist tax to pay upon arrival.   in all, a wonderful apartment to have spent our time in amsterdam. "
"petit endroit très charmant, très bien placé, avec mon copain nous avons vécu un très bon séjour, et nous nous sentions chez nous dans cette chambre. je recommande vivement. "
"we stayed in alex's studio for 3 nights. alex was friendly and helpful greeting us with a map and showing us all major tourist places and where to go, etc.  the studio is in a really great location in the centre of amsterdam, walking distance from everywhere but you can take the tram right outside the apartment door either."
"our host was very helpful although he asked me to pay the city tax in cash to him at check in, even though i had already paid it through airbnb. i thought this was a bit sketchy as really airbnb hosts should never ask for extra cash without having disclosed that up front. when i explained i already paid it he didn't press it but i still thought it was unprofessional. however the room is as it looks and as the description says, it's very comfortable and great location. "
"wir haben anfang märz 2 nächte bei alex übernachtet.  die kommunikation  vorher  und während unseres aufenthalts war sehr gut, freundlich und unkompliziert.  das zimmer war sauber und und mit allem ausgestattet was man für einen kurztrip braucht. das badezimmer ist sehr klein aber auch vollkommen ausreichend.  die lage ist perfekt um die stadt zu fuß oder mit dem fahrrad zu erkunden. wir werden bei unserem nächsten aufenthalt  in amsterdam wieder bei alex übernachten.  wir waren sehr zufrieden. "
"alex was a great host. he worked with us because we had an usually early arrival into amsterdam and was welcoming from the moment we arrived at his house.   the room is very close to everything in the city center. it is about a 5-15 minute walk or tram ride to nearly every place of interest in the city. and if you choose to take the tram, there is a stop directly in front of alex's entrance.   alex provided us with a map of amsterdam and gave us some advice, but left us alone to explore thereafter. he was always available if we needed to contact him though.   the bathroom was quite small, though this seems to be common in holland and the street grew louder at night the closer it got to the weekend. but overall no complaints. would definitely stay here again. "
"alex met us when we arrived and showed us around and explained the keys.  this was a bit rushed, but was very clear; and when i called a few minutes later with a question he'd already answered he was very kind.   the bed and linens are nicer than in my own home, so that was a treat!  the bedroom is spacious and the bathroom is tiny but has everything you need, including plenty of hot water.   the location is ideal: easy walking distance to the major museums and historic amsterdam.  we had a wonderful time and would happily stay here again on future trips to amsterdam."
"lovely location. very central, perfect to visit  amsterdam's center.   the kitchen equipment is a bit minimal, but good stay overall."
"room as described, very comfortable bed and spacious room. bathroom a bit tight but everything worked properly. there is also a fridge which is an asset. tram stop just in front of the place which is very comfortable.   we didn't meet alex but his friend jan came to greet us, very helpful and kind person . he gave us some special tips and places to visit and kept contact till the end.   the only things i would add to this place considering that it's not a cheap place are an electric kettle and some cups and glasses. the shower curtain should be changed into a glass one as it's very annoying having it sticked  with you while you're showering in a small shower . i don't find it fair to have to pay for the towels and linen if you need them to be changed before 4 days or so (i don't exactly remember the days ) .   please note that i would still book this place if i make it back to amsterdam . :)"
the flat was clean and comfortable.
"apartment is just as described and the bed is quite comfortable! location is perfect - we were able to walk to everything... shopping, nightlife, restaurants, the canals, etc. very convenient. only minor downside was that the bathroom is tight - but other than that, was very enjoyable!"
"i've stayed in 2 or 3 star hotels in amsterdam hotel before and budget wise, staying here definitely was worth the money.  the room was very clean and spacious, bed was comfortable, location was central (tram stop was literally a couple steps outside the door but with the beautiful weather that day we just walked around amsterdam instead) and alex was friendly and super prompt to reply us whenever we needed anything! also loved the fact that there was a lovely quaint little cafe just downstairs which served good coffee and cakes.  only down side was that as with any typically older buildings in amsterdam, the sound proofing wasn't great.  so you could hear your neighbours walking above you in the middle of the night.  and it would've been nice if there was a kettle in the room.  but all things that were bearable during our stay.   would still definitely recommend staying here anytime.  "
  flat was as described. location was great with tram stop right outside. our flight was delayed by an hour so we exchanged texts with alex (who lives above) and his hand over was therefore a bit rushed but it was clear. tight spiral staircase to flat but rail to hold onto. bed large and comfortable. bathroom very small but adequate. would have loved a kettle and mugs so we could make a hot drink and glasses that fit under the tap to drink water.  fridge was a bonus. cafe for coffee/breakfast is next door and plenty of eating places nearby.  make sure you get the hang of the window opening as it's a bit stiff.
"the apartment was in a very well placed neighborhood, with easy acces to the tram and other transports, very clean, alex was always very helplfull."
"as described. perfect, central location. "
"when i got there he yelled at me for being late 1 hour. i apologize and tried to talk him that our flight was delayed 45 mins, and then it tooks is a bit to find internet to find the location of the place. he talked again at me and told me that i should've called or sent a message. very rude!"
we were in amsterdam for the first time.  the room was as described. the location is very central and easy to find. a tram stop is right in front of the door. the staircase is spiral and very narrow (not easy to get bigger suitcases up). the room itself is located on the second floor. double bed - very large and very comfortable. the bathroom is very small but clean and well maintained with a small window. there is also a small fridge available and some glasses.  a café is located directly downstairs in the building with good breakfast offers.  only con was that only one window in the room can be opened (and that only tilted). wifi has adequate speed (you can choose from 3 accesspoints).  our host alex was nice and friendly and gave us a quick introduction to the appartment and amsterdam in general. overall it was a great stay and a top location to discover the city.
it was really nice stay in alex place. the place has perfect location and is very clean and comfortable. we had great contact with alex from the moment i booked the room till the moment we left. he was very responsive and helpful. he even made room available a bit earlier which was great! there is a fridge in the room and all the basics. this place is definitely worth recommendation!
great location and place! everything was super easily accessible by walking. it was really nice of alex to give us the rundown on places to hit up and things to watch out for when we first checked in.
petite chambre très bien placée dans amsterdam. nous avons passé 2 jours en amoureux. c était parfait! alex est sympathique et arrangeant.  merci!
muy buena experiencia!! excelente ubicación y muy confortable la cama.. algo pequeño el baño pero con muy buena ducha... volveremos!! 
"my girlfriend and i had a nice stay at the room alex is offering, we didn't meet alex in person though. the place is close to the center and the tram/bus stop so the place is great if you are looking for a central space to sleep. it doesn't have the personal touch and flair of a private apartment, more of a hostel room. i guess it was built just for airbnb purposes. we can recommend it anyways to all sorts of travellers!"
"a perfect room, so clean and especialy the location, few minutes walk from all the sightseeing, and a trmway stop just nxt to the door, i will definitely book it again."
"alex's place was amazing! he was away at the time, but connor greeted us and he was very friendly and welcoming :)  the room itself was great. spacious enough for two people, with anything you could need. the bed was incredibly comfortable.  the location of the room is perfect, so easy to walk to everywhere we wanted to go. so many restaurants and bars nearby and only like a 10 min walk right into the centre of amsterdam.  thanks so much to alex and connor for having us stay, we would definitely stay there again :) "
"room was very nice - good location and nice size room for amsterdam.  alex was responsive, and his friend met us at the door and helped with the bags.  room was very clean and comfortable, like staying in a hotel.  would stay here again!"
"lovely and cozy appartment with walking distance to ""almost everything"" the city of amsterdam has to offer. we didn't need to use any money on public transportation during our stay. the only con with the appartment is the ventalation.  there was only one window we could open for fresh air, and the appartment felt really warm on several occasions. "
"the room is nice and clean. there is enough space and although it faces a busy street the windows do its job to keep the noise out. the bathroom is a bit smaller but manageable for a few days stay. the shower varied in temperature and pressure, but also okay. conor, who was there at our arrival was very pleasant and helpful, which was a great surprise because from my previous communications alex (the host), was impatient in settling the check in time and when i kindly asked if it was possible to change it, he said ""too many changes, fine now but will not change anymore"". i thought that was rude since i had not asked to change it before. but anyway, we ended up not meeting him and that's why i said meeting conor was a nice surprise. the location is great. i recommend it!"
"was great staying at the apartment, was only 10 minutes into dam square so the location was ideal.   the bathroom was a little small and there was a problem with one of the windows. we also found that there wasn't much lighting in the room. this aside, the room and bathroom were very clean with all the essentials provided, and the bed was comfortable.  alex was away during our stay so we checked-in with conor who was very friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions we had.   we would certainly stay here again on our next trip to amsterdam.   "
"alex was very welcoming, gave instructions how to get to the place, met me at the door and was generally very friendly. i never had any issues during my one week of stay. the studio is situated in a very convenient location and right next to it is a very vibrant area with bars, restaurants and such. other places are also very accessible. i would recommend staying there. would recommend staying there."
he allowed us to check in an hour earlier which was awesome ! the neighbourhood was great ! close to everything ! apartment was clean and perfect for 2 people ! i would definitely recommend to stay here !
"i felt like we were lucky to stay in such a central location! we walked out the door, turned right, and just a block away were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping. the apartment is practically around the corner from rembrandt square!   the only thing that put a damper on the trip was when i communicated that our train had been delayed and would get in at 7:30 instead of 4:30, still within the original 2-10pm check-in guidelines. alex's immediate response was that we were pretty much sol because he would not be home and there was no way for us to get the keys to our room. eventually he was able to get a friend to wait for our arrival in order to let us in, show us our room and explain all the rules. however, he charged us extra money for the inconvenience.  it took a lot of back-and-forth texting to get to that point. i was stressing out.  i think that it would be nice if he had a contingency plan in case of delays that are out of the guests' control.  once we got settled everything was fine. the room is more spacious than i expected, the bed is comfortable, and we were glad to have a tv. the bathroom is a little small but has good water pressure.  it was like a hotel room with no access to other areas of the house, and that was fine with us. i would recommend staying there and being careful to make sure your arrival time is accurate. you might want to give yourself a little cushion to account for arriving, not just the time your flight or train gets in, because he won't wait around for long and might try to charge you for making a change.  but again, the location is just perfect for walking out the front door and getting to explore the center of the city by walking or biking.  have fun!"
the studio's location in the center of amsterdam is absolutely perfect to visit the city and the room is very nice and clean. we spent a great weekend there. 
"convenient location, easy to get everywhere and tram station just in front of house. "
"unbeatable location, walking distance to all major touristic sights. it was easy to get the keys. the studio was clean. it had a tv, wifi, a small fridge and i tiny private bathroom. "
"a representative of our host was waiting for us at the agreed time, made us welcome, showed us the amenities and gave us keys."
"alex was a really good host, the room is in a central place in the city. everything looked like what we expected. "
"destaco la ubicación como lo mejor! llegas andando a todos los sitios claves para visitar, y muy bien comunicado! la habitación estaba limpia y con mucha privacidad! en las fotos parece más grande que lo que es pero en amsterdam las viviendas son pequeñas! el baño muy pequeño pero con todo lo necesario y muy limpio! alex fue muy amable y nos acogió muy bien estando disponible siempre para todo lo que necesitáramos! sin duda repetiremos! "
great location 
"the room was beautiful, very clean and the bed was big and very comfortable. had a lovely stay. the bathroom is small but has everything we needed and there was even shampoo and body wash although we had brought our own. it was also nice and warm even though it was freezing cold outside which was good. only negative was the host was slightly abrupt over messaging after a very small misunderstanding prior to arrival which made us a bit apprehensive about arrival but we were met by connor who was lovely and had no further issues! "
"quite apartment in the city center of amsterdam, it's perfect for a couple and the host it's very hospitality and have disponibiliy abou request of the guest. i was here with my girlfriend and i suggest "
great room in an excellent location. the whole process was very friendly and straightforward. 
"great stay. host was helpful and told us everything we needed to know about the apartment. extremely comfortable and a great location. within walking distance of everything in amsterdam! bed was comfortable, good showerhead and good tv! just make sure to check if the windows are actually closed during the winter since there is a counter-intuitive vent on top of the windows. it got left open and it took us a while to figure out why the room was so cold despite the heater being on high--not fun in november--but once we figured it out the room got nice and cozy!"
"we enjoyed our stay, alex's place is not on the a canal but is great walking distance from lots of great sites in amsterdam. perfectly clean, and had the advantage of a fridge as well."
"alex made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions and offered to help with anything if we needed assistance.  the location was perfect for discovering amsterdam on foot. we were close to all kinds of shops and museums etc. the tram stop was immediately outside the door and came by very frequently. we didn't need to use it except on our arrival and departure. about 10 minutes or less from central station.  this is a very old house , as described by alex, so don't let the steep stairs and worn walls of the entrance hall put you off: the room is as shown in the pictures and is quite roomy and comfortable. lots of heat and hot water provided. the wi-fi was excellent. though on a busy street it was surprisingly quiet at night and in the mornings. we had a very comfortable sleep in a very comfy bed! we found the fridge a very good asset to us.i could find no fault with the apartment except i would like at least one bright light for reading our travel guide.  as others have said in reviews the high toilet is a little inconvenient but you get used to it. and when you love the convenience of the location and all the other assets outlined above, it doesn't really matter!  before we travelled to amsterdam i asked alex would he consider supplying a kettle and two cups but he graciously declined!it would have been so convenient! but there are numerous cafes round about.  alex didn't bother us during our stay and was easy when it came to our departure. i would recommend this apartment for a short stay in fabulous amsterdam and it would be our dream to return and hopefully alex will host us again!      "
"great place to stay! clean and in the best location, without walking distance to most tourist attractions. "
"very cozy room in a fantastic location. it says private room but it was basically a hotel room; private access, private lock, etc. i would recommend as the perfect place for anyone looking to explore the city of amsterdam and wants a place to store bags and sleep. "
"the room is exactly as described and in a great location, had a fantastic stay!"
"great location, clean and cozy. easy to communicate with alex. i'd love to stay here again. "
"cosy, clean and romantic room in the heart of amsterdam city center. a 15 to 20min walk from amsterdam central station or just 10min by tram that literally stops in front of the airbnb. 5min from rembrandt square where there are a dozen of restaurants. extremely comfortable if you want to spend time in the city center. the house is old and the room is on the 2nd floor. you have to go up a narrow stairs, so it is preferable to come here if you travel light. bed is great and the area is relatively quiet. the bathroom is cold during the winter and kinda small, but nothing to complain about. the host alex was friendly and to the point. discuss with him  regarding the key for when you have to check out."
amazing apartment so close to everything in amsterdam! nice and clean. quiet at night. it was just a room which we knew but sometimes it is nice just to have a kettle. out of our control our plans changed and alex was very up set about this which made us feel very uncomfortable initially. lovely stay.
"we spent a great time in this room which was clean, comfortable, and just in front of the tram station (very  close to the city center). alex was welcoming and very reactive when we had a question : it's definitely an experience we could repeat (website hidden by airbnb)"
"very easy and straightforward journey from the airport to the room. we arrived earlier than expected and were greeted by alex who was very friendly and welcoming. he left us the keys, recommended a place to start our evening and was on his way 5 minutes later to leave us to get on with our trip. the room was clean, warm and the bed very comfortable. shower had very good water pressure and easy to use. location was perfect and we were able to walk easily to everywhere we wanted to go. me and my girlfriend agreed we would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to amsterdam. highly recommend to couples looking to stay in the city."
"super gastgeber, super appartment. für einen kurzen und angenehmen aufenthalt zu zweit jeder zeit zu empfehlen!"
"el lugar está realmente bien ubicado, cerca de la mayoría de la cosas a ver en amsterdam pero el wifi no funciona para nada y sobretodo no está preparado para el invierno.....hacían -4 cuando fuimos y no hay calefacción en el baño, no hay doble vidriado y solo tiene un pequeño radiador que encima no funciona del todo bien....literalmente tuvimos que irnos a las 12 de la noche del segundo día porque no aguantabamos el frío. "
"exactly as described, brilliant location, spacious bedroom, a fantastic stay! "
"alex was rude. not friendly, we didn't feel welcome. he yelled at us for being 10mins early (who does that?! unbelievable). it almost seem like we were bothering him. he needs to work on his social skills. nevertheless, place was centric and cute. "
the host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
"alex's place is amazing. it is in the center of amsterdam, as well as the train station. it is 3 minutes away from the torture museum, 5 minutes away from the dungeon and it's close to public transport.  the place is clean, cozy and quiet. highly recommend!"
"the room was comfortable and really well situated, not far from the city center. we had a very good stay."
alex's house was centrally located and perfect to get to know the city during my first few days in amsterdam. easy to find and very close to many of the local attractions. 
"great place. thanks for the warm welcome alex. alex is very punctual and very helpful with information around the city. the room is spacious and cozy. the place is about 4 tram stops from centraal station. you can take tram no.16 which stops right in front of the place. very easy to find the place. walking distance to the flower market, dam square and royal palace. enjoyed our stay and hopefully can stay there again in the future."
"this private room was as expected. you have to go up a bit of steps to get to the studio, which wasn't a big deal at all, but just a warning if you have a hard time going up stairs or have super heavy luggage. the location is good, pretty close to museums, and to central amsterdam. i've never experienced an airbnb that charges for early/late checkout after set times, and that also will charge for baggage hold even after all airbnb fees are paid. wasn't too stoked on that as most airbnb hosts will let you check in early for free and will hold your bags for free as well if possible, but this is noted in the description. so nothing to really complain about. good location, clean room and clean and private bathroom- but small. we had a nice stay and host was very nice. "
"very good place to visit amsterdam between the city center and museum place ! room comfortable, small bathroom, all you need for few days ..."
top lage und schönes zimmer. haus ist zwar hellhörig und das bad ist sehr klein aber alles in allem trotzdem sehr zu empfehlen.
"the location of the room is amazing, very central and close to lots of bars etc in the area without being loud outside.  "
alex is a friendly host who gave us a warm welcome and explained the details of the house and the city. the location is perfect and we had a good stay! :) 
"excellent séjour. logement très propre, bien situé, et conforme aux photos. arrivée dans les lieux simple, claire et rapide. seul bémol, wifi pas très performant. je recommande vivement ce logement !"
great location and alex was very helpful.  would totally recommend this to my anyone :)  
第一次也是最后一次使用airbnb｡ 房价很贵 而且态度一点也不好｡
très bien placé. permet d'accéder à de nombreuses attractions d'amsterdam pour quelques jours
"perfect location, comfortable bed"
great location!  5 to 10 minutes by tram from central station or enjoy the sights and make the 15 to 20 min walk.  we had a great flat that overlooks the main street giving us a great view of the busy city below.  our private bathroom was clean and efficient. the mini refrigerator was nice and gave us a spot to keep some snacks cold. we felt completely safe and secure our entire stay.  the central location gave us quick access to all of the sights and public transportation that takes you anywhere you want to go quickly.  we found great pubs and restaurants and even a fresh food market within walking distance of our home away from home.  rembrandt square is just around the corner. our host was great and did a great job communicating with us before our stay and was completely accessible to us if we needed him during our visit.  this is a nice home base to visit amsterdam! 
the location was great but be warned. the bathroom is very small and the room is not as well lit as the pictures show.
"perfect location, with a convenient coffee / croissant shop downstairs. the room was bright and sunny. "
"i am 100% satisfied with my stay here. looks like the pictures and has everything that was promised. very comfortable bed, nice bathroom and all the extra that is needed (tv, hairdryer...).   the location is perfect for someone who want to experience amsterdam by foot (but also really close to the tram). the road outside i busy but that can't be heard from the room.   we had breakfast at the café right next to the house. can be recommended! "
perfect and central! we could walk everywhere and alex was a lovely and helpful host! 
"alojamiento impecable, genial localización"
"nice, cozy, small and clean apartment placed in the heart of amsterdam. you can reach the city centre and everything else within some minutes of walking. however, the price per night seems a little unjustified regarding the size of the apartment. in addition to that, the walls are wafer-thin, hence it is an old house. the house is situated next to a main street which might be very noisy, too. but this depends on the daytime. nonetheless, the accommodation  is ideal for spending just a couple of nights. alex, the host, has been very friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. we would recommend this apartment, if you are planning to stay in amsterdam just for several days."
"the room is very comfortable and private. me and my mother are glad to stay in alex's place, because he is so nice and willing to help us cope with issues.   it's good to live in central place, which means you can walk to any tourist attractions conveniently. actually, alex place just locates in the central line of amsterdam, between the central station and amsterdam national museum.  "
the room is perfect for couples who want something within walking distance to amsterdam's biggest attractions. it was clean and the bed was comfy. 
clean & comfortable. alex was prompt with all communication so my experience with his accommodations were seamless. the room might be smaller than what you expect from looking at the pictures but it was plenty for what we needed. the only suggestion i have is to furnish the room with a full length mirror l or place the wall mirror lower. some of us travelers are shorter than the native dutch ;)
"the stay here was great. me and my boyfriend have visited amsterdam a number of times but this was our first airbnb. please remember to bring your own towels and loo paper if you're staying for a while, these weren't replaced or replenished. apart from that, everything was as expected. the location is great so it can be a bit busy at night. the downside to this was there was a man who claimed he knew alexander and tried to enter our room every night. clearly intoxicated but luckily my boyfriend knows jujitsu and was able to fight him off night after night.   apart from that, 5 stars alex. great stay"
"the location is great! and the room was beautiful. i loved the wall of windows, and the old beam ceiling. it was decorated beautifully. "
a beautiful place in a beautiful location! pleasant host! thank you!
very central location. alex was easy to communicate with. getting from the airport to the studio was a bit of a challenge and a walk especially if you have luggage. the stairs are super narrow which is challenging when carrying luggage. very central location and close to all the fun and beauty of amsterdam but the room was quiet and very comfortable. wifi was a bit spotty but i would stay here again. thank you alex!
"this flat is in easy walking distance of the city's main attractions. there were lots of great restaurants / bars very close by. the room was well presented and clean, although it is situated on a busy road. we slept well with the windows shut as it blocked out the noise, but might not be so ideal for someone looking for a peaceful, tranquil location."
great place to stay in a central location. alex was great at communicating and setting up a check in time. room is big and clean wifi was a bit unreliable at times as there were multiple options to connect to.  close to great nightlife. 20min walk from centraal station and close to the trams.  thanks alex!!
great location. alex was prompt at the agreed upon check in time and the room was bigger than expected and very clean.
"très calme la nuit , à proximité des commerces et du centre . alex est un hôte très gentil , le logement très propre."
"you can't go wrong with this place, in the heart of amsterdam, on top of an amazing coffee shop and ice cream shop!  the room is spacious, sunny, and just perfect, the bathroom could be slightly bigger!  alex was very welcoming and responsive!  amsterdam is simply amazing!!"
perfect location. city center is very close to alex's place. it's like a hotel room.
location was easy to find and accommodation is clean. overall a good stay! thank you for hosting us!
"alex's place is in a great location, close to many sights such as rembrandt square. there is also a tram stop really close by. very convenient for exploring other areas of the city.  the building itself is quite old. you'll need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. i would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. the wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. the building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. the bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. as there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. if you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. we jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to   c'est magnifique at leidsestraat 18) below and nearby. if not for the above-mentioned points, i would rate this room 5 stars, as the location is really good."
"¡hola! si buscas una cama cómoda y además que el apartamento este bien ubicado, sin duda te recomiendo hospedarte aquí. alex te entrega ls llaves de tu habitación y del edificio por lo que tus entradas y salidas son independientes, a demás de que fue puntual en hacerlo. en lo personal la habitación me encanto, no te llevas descripción alguna si lo comparas con la imagen."
"about a week before we were due to arrive in amsterdam we received three or four messages from the host concerning our check-in time. we had received others before this, however they appeared as automatic messages, and did not respond(this was our mistake, of course). a few on this occasion appeared to be automatic messages, however there were a few more after which were quite panicked and regarded our expected check-in time. alex said that he had planned a trip to germany and that he wouldn't be able to check us in and that we would have to pay a 25€ service charge for somebody else to wait and check us in. it was still a week before we were due to arrive, and we did not feel we needed to provide a check-in time this soon. while it is not alex's fault that we did not respond to his messages initially, we found his responses quite blunt, and had a lot of emphasis on how the situation ""was not his fault"". at no point did we blame him for the situation, and we paid the charge for our check-in, which was within the times provided on his page, as he had to get somebody to wait for us.  the accomodation and ammenities were all up to standard, and it appears from his reviews that alex is a nice guy and a thoughtful host. perhaps we caught him at a bad time, but we felt his communication with us was quite rude and unnecessarily panicked.   thank you for providing us with your home alex."
really perfect place in city centre. clean and nice room but a little cold. alex was kind and helpful. we recommend this place.
"perfect simple space to be able to come back to after exploring the city all day. it is easy to walk to most parts of the city from here but is also in a quiet are so got a great night sleep (in an extremely comfy bed!). also a good value for money for 2 poor students, so was able to leave us with some more cash to explore the city. alex was a fantastic host. would highly recommend."
"alex’s apartment was in a great location and is highly walkable, however our stay was not ideal. in a role where customer service and cultural competency matter a great deal, my wife and i found alex to be demanding (he changed our check-in time without discussion or appreciation) and rude (i understand the dutch can be direct in their communication, however the first thing alex did was insult and offend us). as someone who deeply values the human interaction element of airbnb, and with so many options in amsterdam, i would not stay here again."
"amazing location in the heart of the city. nice decor. alex was very down-to-business about the airbnb, but respectful. we had some issues with the wifi and the fridge.   will recommend mostly for the location."
"central but quiet as it is slightly away from bars and clubs. really great location, loads of cafes and restaurants nearby. room was good - bathroom was cold at times as we had to leave the window open. bed was really big and really comfy after a long day. lovely to stay for a weekend "
"the room was clean and cosy and very centrally located. i wasn't expecting to have a fridge, so it was a nice surprise. we were able to come and go as we needed and didn't feel like we were imposing. it was a lovely stay right in the middle of what i assumed would be a very busy time of year. christmas in amsterdam is just beautiful."
"the room is perfectly located for exploring amsterdam and has the added benefit of a coffee shop underneath it, wonderful for your early morning cup of tea. the room is stylish and spotlessly clean and the bed is so comfortable you have to force yourself out in the morning! thank you alex for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home."
"very nice place to take some days in amsterdam, very close to some museums and the life in the city."
good place! a bit cold in the night didn't expect that and the bathroom is very small. but generally the location is amazing!! and it's perfect for 1/2 nights stay
"super logement, propreté et état impeccable. emplacement parfait. je recommande sans hésitations."
"great place, right downtown, very spacious. thanks alex! :)"
super central studio. had a supernice stay.
alex met us at 2pm for check in and gave us some tips and guides for our time in amsterdam! the apartment is in a great location and was perfect for a few days stay. the bed was so comfy!! would stay here again - thank you alex!
"alex's place is in a great location for those who have never been to amsterdam before. it is a short walk to any of the local tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.  the room was clean although quite small and simple but that was perfect for us who were not planning on staying in the room for very long other than sleeping and washing.  only draw back was only one window opened slightly which made the room a bit stuffy at night. all in all a good stay though. definetily recommend for those wanting to stay in a central location."
"great location. alex was a good host,even bringing us a fan for an unusually warm april stay."
"the location was very nice and walking distance to everything we needed. the room was clean and big, note that the building is older and doesn’t have an elevator."
"πολυ ωραιος χωρος, ο οικοδεσποτης ευγενεστατος. το προτεινω ανεπιφυλακτα!"
"clean and very nice location. definitely value for money!! only downside is the fact that you can hear every footsteps of the guests above very loud, and it seemed like our upstairs neighbors walked around a lot with shoes on."
"nice place, calm and comfortable."
everything was perfect!
"we enjoyed our stay with alex and loved the location. it was very easy to get around the city by walking or taking public transportation.   the building is very old and so our room was very hot for it being end of may/beginning of june. our host offered us a 2nd fan which helped but the windows can’t be opened very much so it is very hard to get the room ventilated. also, the wifi was a bit unreliable. "
clean stylish room close to everything. thank you
"le foto della camera rispecchiano esattamente la realtà. camera molto pulita, confortevole e vicina al centro. alex (host) è stato disponibile sin da subito ed è molto gentile. la consiglio assolutamente, é stata una bellissima vacanza"
"el departamento de alex es muy confortable y limpio, con todos los elementos necesarios para una buena estadía,  nos recibió con una botella de agua y vino de recepción, un excelente detalle, "
the apartment of alex is very nice and the perfect choice to enjoy amsterdam. it’s near everything! we re happy we spent our days there.
excellent location and lovely room! 
"had an awesome stay.  great location, walking distance from everything. we’ll be back for sure."
"thank you for being so accommodating, communication with yourself was so easy! the area was perfect for us not to close but no so far 10 min walk from city centre loved it! we would revisit most definetly"
alex has a nice little apartment within walking distance of all the sights of amsterdam.  alex was very hospitable and gave tips of what to see on our trip.
"perfect! in the center of the city with nice stores in the neighbourhood. easy check-in, very clean and comfortable room!"
right in the city center. clean space with a comfy bed and private bathroom (with small shower). alex was very friendly and provided suggestions about things to do in the city. overall great experience.
great location   
alex’s place is perfect! location is great and perfect size for just 2 of you. he was very helpful if we needed anything and always contactable.  only problem we had was the place was extremely warm as there is no aircon and only one window slightly opens. also the wifi connection is very poor.
"chambre très sympa, très propre et merveilleusement bien placée. merci alex "
thank you very much 
"amazing location, walking distance from all major attractions. the space was very clean and alex is very accommodating and quick to respond to messages "
the location is probably the best part. alex’s place is very clean and quiet. great place to refuel so you can see the city!
everything is ok! slow wi-fi.
"good location, had a bad check in experience since he was not responding."
"desde los mensajes que te manda es grosero y poco profesional, por tal razón, no quisimos ni siquiera llegar a su hospedaje, le dije que haría check in y a qué hora  y no me respondió, así que asumí que no me esperaría porque ya me había amenazado que si no le contestaba pronto no me quería ver en su casa!! así tal cuál con esas palabras, por eso me puse a ver sus evaluaciones y me di cuenta que ya había tratado a más personas así que , por lo tanto no llegamos. el trato debe ser cordial desde un principio y el no lo es así que no lo recomiendo en lo absoluto."
perfect place in amsterdam. felt like home. very clean. quiet.
"alex's place has very good location - close to the dam and central station, and has many restaurants and shops within 10min walking distance. closest tram station is 200m away.  the room is very clean, good value and highly recommended!"
we left booking our accommodation a bit late so weren't really sure what to expect when we arrived but we couldn't have been more pleased when we arrived! perfect location within easy reach of all of the main tourist attractions. lovely comfy bed and blackout curtains which helped block out some of the noise from the road (which wasn't particularly loud even when the curtains were open) would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting amsterdam.
"i had a very nice trip to amsterdam. the room was clean and like in the pictures. those big windows in the morning are an amazing boost for the day. the house is very well placed. you are basically near everything you have to visit in amsterdam. we didn't used any tram, we walked and it was very cool. i recommend this place and if i will come back i guess i will come back to alexander."
i had a nice stay here. the location was good and the place was super clean. i’d stay here again.
"the stay at alex' apartment has been very nice. the flat is very well located and you walk to the centre in under 5-10 minutes. the bed is insanely comfortable. just the bathroom is a little tiny, but that was no big issue.  we can recommend the place very much if you want to stay for a short trip :)"
très agréable et super emplacement.  je le recommande fortement.
"me hospede en el piso de alex.  es muy hermoso y la ubicación es buena, pero lo que realmente me hizo pasar mal y dudar en el momento de si perder mi dinero e irme a un hotel o quedarme allí fue el trato con alex. desde el momento 1 fue bastante rudo con los mensajes solo porque yo estaba trabajando y no los podía leer. le expliqué y ya me había molestado bastante su forma de hablarme.  luego tuve otro problema cuando llegue a amsterdam, habíamos arreglado que me iría a buscar y me llevaría a la casa. llegue y alex esperaba que yo pudiera llegar sola a una terminal de salidas siendo que iba por primera vez a amsterdam, no tengo porque conocer el aeropuerto y además algo obvio. llegamos en arribos y salidas esta al otro lado del aeropuerto. la comunicación fue malísima y el no nos habló nada bien. es bastante grosero. realmente me saco de quicio la situación y me tomé un uber porque era muy complicado.  la casa es hermosa, pero no se si vale la pena, el trato es muy importante y es la primera impresión."
overall decent
"alex's room is in a great location and is really good value for money (if you don't check in early/late)!    the room had all the basics and was in such a fantastic location, especially given the reasonable price. the bed was comfortable and we had all the basics we needed. we only stayed for one night and it was perfect for us for one night. if you wanted to stay longer, it may be worth noting that the bathroom is pretty small and there are no tea making facilities/only plastic cups for drinking water from the bathroom tap.   my main negative was that, as soon as we booked, we received an email with a list of extra costs for early/late check in (€25/35!), baggage storage etc. and it came across incredibly unfriendly and gave me the impression that the host was going to try to find any excuse to charge me extra. but everything was fine and we didn't pay anything extra.   overall, the room was perfect for us for a one night stay and really good value. thanks!"
great apartment in a central location. we were able to walk everywhere and everything was in a 10-15 minute radius. small apartment but cute and worth it for your trip to amsterdam.
alex was very prompt with our check in and check out! everything was clean and in order. great location for seeing the city!
"very clean and cosy apartment with a central location! the room is well equipped and has a nice view on the busy street, but nevertheless it is very quiet inside. the bathroom is really small, but very clean and modern!"
"i wouldn't stay here again unless there was literally no other option, or that i didn't have enough time to book elsewhere.  the apartment is very nicely located, with a grocery store less than 5 minutes away.. and a very comfortable bed. that's all the good things i have to mention.  wi-fi did not work any of the days we stayed there, not even the ""other"" networks they recommended us to connect to, in practicality we were offline while here.  the apartment building is more like a poorly renovated area, with a poorly built, minuscule staircase, no elevator (which we knew), and literally dirty, messed up drywall that hasn't been cleaned since construction.  this is nothing more than a bed in a room with a door.. there's no love in this apartment, there's nothing worth writing about in it, it's literally barebones minimalism, in a good location."
nice room
"alexander had a nice room in an amazing location to sight see. it was a little noisy at night, as you can hear every movement of the person staying above you. also we couldn’t get the tv and the internet to work. we weren’t in the room much though, so that wasn’t a major issue for us. the bed was comfortable, and the room was nice overall. we would stay again."
"alexander’s place was perfect for our stay in amsterdam. not only was the room very clean and conveniently located, but when issues arose, alexander helped us to find a solution quickly and efficiently. thanks again for a wonderful stay!"
very cozy room and not far from the city.
great place in a central part of amsterdam. highly recommend
"the room is cosy, exactly as we see in the pictures. the building is located near the center and the street is quiet. alexander was not there on this period but his friend zika help us a lot in everything "
lovely room in a perfect location for a long weekend in amsterdam. we were able to walk everywhere which was great. the room was cosy and the bed was lovely and big.
the apartment is in an amazing location and all you need for a short break away.
fantastic location for amsterdam central! clean and tidy perfect for a night or 2.
good place for a weekend trip. alexanders friend was helpful for setting everything up.
"very bad experience.  he glued the chewing gum on the pillow, and alexander always late reply, and he said he need to work, will give us the key very late when we’re coming. this guy is a joke, do not try to sleep here."
cute little place perfectly located in the center. wish we stayed longer.
perfect location right in the middle of everything! alexander was quick to check us in and the place is well maintained!
"alexander’s apartment was in a great location, within walking distance to all major attractions. it was very clean and everything we could need was provided."
"the apartment was spacious clean and perfectly located for transport, cafes, facilities and tourist sights. the apartment had great views and it had a fully serviced kitchen which was suitable for cooking meals. it had a lift which is a huge plus in amsterdam. the check in and check out was very easy, friendly and efficient. we were met at the agreed time. i would fully recommend the apartment and would visit there again when we next go to amsterdam."
a large sunny apartment in a great location with all amenities including an elevator up a few steps.  the tram is right outside and the supermarket is steps away. jordan is a interesting neighborhood on its own and it's close to the museum's and other sights.
"excellent accommodation, close to everything, lovely hosts, beautiful breakfasts, a unique place to stay in beautiful amsterdam "
"what can i say, flip provided the perfect amsterdam experience for us and did so on a beautiful boat. it's located on the water near the city center. he provides bikes and a canoe (although we didn't have a chance to use that).     breakfast is left each morning in your cabin and is the nicest european breakfast i've had to date. wonderful breads, meats, cheese and jams.     the space is surrounded by water and is in a very safe neighborhood. we walked all over the city quite easily.     i can't thank flip enough for being the perfect host. thanks for making our trip so wonderful!"
"ottima accoglienza, un soggiorno da ripetere. flip cura molto il servizio che offre, la colazione è abbondante e molto variata. le bici che include nel prezzo sono comodissime per visitare la città. molto positiva tutta l'esperienza. attenzione al parcheggio, se siete in auto, 24 h costano 40 euro come nel resto del centro città..."
just a superb way to spend time in amsterdam. a very well constructed space within this boat creates a very comfortable environment. very close to town and central station and a very comfortable bed. just when you think things can't get any better flip turns up with a breakfast that wows. flip is all very helpful and interesting. highly recommended. the bikes are the icing on the cake. also flip has a little hidden gem of a restaurant to point you to.
"perfect from start to finish! flip went above and beyond in every aspect, right down to the perfectly cooked eggs for breakfast :) a+ for a unique experience in a wonderful city"
"why stay anywhere else in the city of canals when you can stay on a house boat? this is absolutely an unique way to spend time in amsterdam. beautiful boat very close to the central station, comfortable space,  great breakfast and the bikes completed the experience. "
"wij hebben een geweldige tijd gehad op de woonboot van flip. bij aankomst lagen er fortune  cookies op de kussens van het bed en op dat moment waren we verkocht. heerlijke plek alles lekker schoon en fris en fantastisch centraal gelegen. 's morgens werd er een heerlijk ontbijt geserveerd die met liefde gemaakt was. we mochten ook nog eens gebruik maken van de fietsen. fietsend door amsterdam was een fantastische beleving. bedankt voor het delen van deze bijzondere plek en wij kijken ernaar uit om in de toekomst een keer terug te komen.. groetjes, guanita & marcel"
"the place was beautiful and bright, even when it was cloudy out. in the evenings, it was warm and cozy. great location for really experiencing amsterdam. the neighborhood felt very safe.     the wifi was fast. check-in was very easy and we were able to check in earlier than many other airbnbs will accommodate, which was helpful for our travel schedule.    the breakfast was as amazing as everyone says. a lot of variety for a catered breakfast."
"flip's houseboat is very cool. it is tastefully designed, comfortable and quiet. what a unique way to experience amsterdam! we especially enjoyed using the canoe to explore the canals. flip is an accommodating and friendly host, and he serves a lovely breakfast. we have nothing but positive things to say about our experience."
"l'endroit est tout simplement génial. le cadre est calme et reposant. la vue donne simplement l'impression de s'évader. bref, c'est le lieu idéal pour un séjour à amsterdam.    pour se déplacer, les vélos sont fournis, on retrouve 2 stations de bus (bus 48 en direction de centruum) à 5min à peine.     la péniche est bien agencée, le petit-déjeuner est délicieux et flip est  super cool. il est prévenant et à l'écoute. vous ne serez pas déçu du détour.    a prendre sans hésiter !"
danke für dieses außergewöhnliche erlebnis! die räder waren absolut perfekt um amsterdam zu entdecken und das frühstück hätte nicht besser sein können. danke flip für seine gastfreundschaft und flexibilität!
"host was marvellous! we are so happy we stayed here with my boyfriend. flip made our stay very welcome and gave us good tips on local places to visit.the boat was superb, very clean and tidy as well as cosy. the breakfast which was served every morning was a delight each day. would definitely recommend for many others to stay here as well. "
amazing place to stay. flip was a great host and his breakfasts were perfect before heading out. the location was just far enough away to get away from the craziness and close enough to enjoy everything ams has to offer. we would return without a second thought!
"this was a great houseboat. location is a bit off the beaten path- in a good way. no tour boats flying by at all hours, peaceful, beautiful. great breakfast in the morning. very quaint quarters but my 6'3"" husband didn't mind and said it was well worth it. bikes included was a huge bonus. less than 5 minute bike ride to some great restaurants, cafes, and shops. would recommend to friends! "
"amazing! the location is great: close to centre but quiet. delicious breakfast: fresh juice, coffee, croissants, eggs and etc. mmmmm.   design of boat is another thing that you will like. all things are stylish and cute.   thank you, flip! "
"we loved or stay on the canel boat!  flip was welcomingand helpful with suggestions for eating.  quiet part of amsterdam.  the space was lovely and we enjoyed breakfast outdoors on dock in the morning.  flip brought over wonderful basket of bread, cheese, sauage, and eggs every morning.  bed was so comfortable.  highly recommend."
"we felt very welcomed right from the very beginning in this wonderful place. cozy and very well kept, flip made us feel like being at home.     the attention to detail and interior design makes ms luctor an unique houseboat experience.    breakfast from the wonderful breakfast basket by the canal is definitively a must, no better place than ms luctor.    we will definitively be back"
"such a wonderful experience! flip was a very welcoming host. he is easy to talk to and full of great tips and suggestions. the houseboat is lovely and cozy. the breakfast that flip brought us every morning was the cherry on top. he also provided us with bikes, which truly is the best way to see amsterdam. it was a great experience staying here! the location is great. quiet but not far from the city centre. very close to the artsy area of amsterdam! definitely recommend staying here. you will not regret it! "
super dagen gehad. boot en fietsen top. ontbijt super en eten aan de overkant bij de gouden reael een aanrader.
i can totally recommend the boat!  flip is a lovely host! my girlfriend and i stayed for 4 days and we really felt at home!  the boat has so many lovely little details and the breakfast is really good and was always a perfect start into the day.  the boat is not to far away from the city. we mainly walked without any problems.     thanks flip!
"peniche hyper confort, chaleureuse, bien équipée ( et bien chauffée). filip est attentif aux détails, et de petites attentions témoignent de son sens de l'accueil. le quartier est tout proche du centre et de la gare. avec les vélos mis à disposition c'est idéal. a conseiller!"
"flip was really lovely and relaxed, even though we checked out at 11am he still let us use his bikes until 4pm which was great!    the breakfast was really extravagant and delicious: cheese, ham, croissants, cereal and boiled eggs.     located right around the corner from a great supermarket and lots of lovely restaurants."
"wow we had a very great experience! skip was very accommodating and was easy to communicate with. the breakfast was the best, and the boat was very clean inside. the bed is extremely comfortable, the wifi worked well. we had a blast!"
"flip est un hôte très accueillant et chaleureux. l'endroit est calme et proche du centre ville (environ 15mn à pied). les vélos prêtés par flip sont en bon état et c'est un excellent moyen de visiter amsterdam. le petit-déjeuner est délicieux avec des bons produits. le logement est conforme aux photos, pour les personnes de grande taille il faudra faire un peu attention mais en même temps c'est normal c'est une péniche :-) bref nous avons passés un superbe séjour !"
ideale locatie voor een tripje naar amsterdam. rustig gelegen en toch vlakbij het centrum. een unieke ervaring. zeer gastvrij ontvangst en bij het ontbijt ontbrak het ons nergens aan. echt een aanrader!
"great place to stay, comfortable and walking distance within everything. great views from the boat. flip was welcoming. "
"flip is a wonderful host, the breakfasts are charming, and the luctor was an experience my fiancé and i will treasure for a lifetime.  highly recommended, safe, romantic, unique!"
"flip was a fantastic host. very friendly and welcoming. very attentive but also gave you space to make it a most excellent stay. breakfast was fantastic full of lovely treats. location is spot on. 5 minutes to walk to everything you need. close enough to be for you to walk it, far away enough to feel like your'e not still in a tourist area. a super relaxing environment, will recommend to friends and we look forward to attending again.  "
true amsterdam exsperience.  exactly what i was searching for when i choose this romantic situation.  the breakfast is amazing and the houseboat is really cute. the silence ok the docks in the morning when you have breakfast in me. luctor is really precious. thanks to flip for the ospitality!
"the stay was pretty good on flip's boat, comfortable and great located. and flip is a good host very helpful, i started missing the breakfast!!"
"super hôte, très arrangeant pour le check in, accueil très agréable, de bons conseils, d'itinéraires et d'adresses.   excellent petit déjeuner avec de bons produits.  péniche agréable, confortable, à 10 min de la gare à pied   les vélos sont très pratiques.  merci beaucoup flip d'avoir rendu notre séjour encore plus agréable!   "
una incantevole permanenza....magia allo stato puro...una cuccia romantica....ottima la distanza dal kaos del centro in quartiere signorile e ben servito . comodo e divertente l'uso delle bici ...splendide le colazioni e impeccabile in padron di casa...da consigliare.
"wir haben unsere flittertage auf diesem wundervollen hausboot verbracht und waren mehr als begeistert! die unterkunft ist genau wie beschrieben, alles sehr sauber und ganz besonders liebevoll eingerichtet-einfach toll! ein besonderes highlight ist sicherlich das frühstück, welches man mit einem herrlichen blick auf die gracht genießen kann. flip ist unglaublich freundlich und die eigens zusammengestellte mappe mit allen wichtigen informationen zu ausflugszielen, märkten, restaurants usw. ist eine tolle hilfe! alles in allem hätte unser aufenthalt nicht schöner sein können und wir freuen uns darauf wiederzukommen!"
"perfect description, friendly and helpful host, great romantic location, 2 bikes and even a canoe!"
"we had an awesome stay on flip's b&b boat. the atmosphere was great, the breakfast bountiful and flip was a very welcoming host. definitely the place to stay in amsterdam!"
"this is a beautiful, charming boat located in the very peaceful westerdok. the surrounding area is beautiful, with a city farm and historic craft beer bar within 2 mins walk (try the oud kase at westerdok bar - it comes on a guillotine!) the breakfast provided by flip was more than enough to make sandwiches for lunch too, and he thoughtfully catered to our dietary needs. bikes and canoe are provided free which is a huge bonus. we were foolish enough to leave our glasses behind but flip messaged us before we even realised and will post them back. a fantastic host with a fantastic boat in a stunning location. we cannot recommend this highly enough!"
"flip er meget flink og imødekommende. vi følte aldrig at vi manglede noget, tværtimod var der altid hjælp at hente. hvis man manglede ideer og inspiration til hvad der var at se og udforske i amsterdam var han altid klar med gode råd. "
we really enjoyed our stay in the houseboat. good atmosphere. beautiful. clean. great breakfast. very convenient to have bikes. flip is an absolutely great host. 
we really liked our stay on flip's canal boat.  it is beautiful to be on the water. the boat had plenty of space with a very comfortable bed. it was also very quiet and peaceful. the breakfast was outstanding with many choices of food and more than one could eat.  having bikes available to explore amsterdam was a big plus.  the boat is in the heart of amsterdam.  flip also helped us call a cab to take us to the airport which made catching our flight easy.
"es war alles super!!! ohne auch nur einen mangel..., perfekt! das ist amsterdam mal anders, eine tolle abwechslung zu einem hotel:-)"
we had a great stay on the ms. luctor. this is probably the best way to stay in amsterdam. the location is perfect - close to the city center and the train station - but in a quiet and relaxing neighborhood.
"amsterdam is a crazy city! with a lot of people and bicycles( besides cars and trams). full of new experience and freedom of mind. we found our silent and comfortable bay near the city central! location is good, owner will offer to you bicycles - which you need to use if you are in amsterdam!:) flip prepared a brilliant breakfast!  you have to try it by your own- that cost it! it was a pleasure to stay in flip's boat. thank you, wish all the best to you and your family! "
"we can't think of a better location to live when in amsterdam! it's in a quite area just a short walk away from the city centre. the two bikes enable you to explore the whole city. the houseboat is a very unique living experience. it's very cozy, functional and has everything you need. flip is a caring and easy going host and he serves delicious breakfast everyday. we recommend this place highly. "
"i highly recommend this houseboat to anyone staying in amsterdam. it is in a great location next to the central station stop. the boat is quiet at night and just across the water were lots of delicious restaurants and a bar or two. the pictures are very accurate and the houseboat was actually much nicer than i was expecting. lots of hot water, lots of thoughtful amenities (like a little bluetooth speaker) and a super comfy bed! breakfast was yummy too, i love dutch cheese <3. i was actually really sad to leave. i could have lived there for a couple months easy no problem. thank you to our lovely host, flip, as well. we will be back next time we come to amsterdam! "
"my stay on the house boat was lovely, definitely one of the most unique airbnbs i have stayed in.  the arrival process was very smooth as flip communicated with me via email to ensure everything was ready by he time i wanted to check in.  there was water and 2 local brews awaiting upon our arrival and the place was very clean.  we had 2 bikes with locks and a canoe to use at our disposal. the house boat is located very close to everything you will want to see in amsterdam but is on a quiet canal which was relaxing.  there is a nice patio outside that we were able to drink wine on and watch boats go by on the canal.  the breakfast provided was delicious, fresh bread and croissants, cheese and sausage, eggs, jams and honey, cereal granola milk and yogurt.. more than enough for 2 people.  the bed is the most comfortable bed i slept in during my entire stay in europe.  additionally flip provides a book with any recommendations for restaurants and sites to see complete with maps and all.  would definitely stay here again!"
"absolutely fantastic! we loved everything- the super comfy bed, the incredible sunsets, delish breakfasts, flip is a pro! would love to stay there again. the location for me was perfect, room to breathe but still in canal district.excellent place for a run as well."
"we stayed for three nights in total and found flip to be an excellent host! the houseboat is lovely, and in a great location within walking distance of town but yet quiet at the same time. the breakfast was fantastic, and having the bikes there is great if you fancy a spin around the city and the nearby park. can't recommend it enough!"
the houseboat was clean and lovely. flip was friendly and the breakfast was bountiful and delicious. make sure you lock it carefully at all times.  
"*the* most amazing place, i have ever stayed at in amsterdam. location is perfect, the boat is a dream, breakfast is delicious, the host is super-friendly and the breakfast: wow! you will have a hard time to find anything comparable to this amazing place! "
amazing- from the moment we walked up to the dock it was great. flip was friendly- gave us really great tips on shopping and food in the area gave us a great tour. best air bnb experience and really made our trip to amsterdam perfect.
"this accommodation is a self-contained section of a bigger boat, where flip lives. so the included breakfast (a very generous one!) comes fresh every morning served at your table.   we've loved the outdoor section (at the end of the pier) with a table setting where we could have a drink at night watching the beautiful canal view and appreciating the calm of this area. you even get the fragrance of a jasmine bush, which is really lovely.  we've used the two bicycles everyday, which allowed us to easily access everything in amsterdam. you can find everything in less than 5 min. away (cafés, restaurants, bars, grocery, and many very cute shops namely on haarlemmerdijt/haarlemmerstraat)  i recommend flip's boat, as i couldn't imagine a better way to enjoy amsterdam! "
"when in amsterdam there is nothing better than staying in a house boat, flip's boat is within walking distant to central station and the city centre. having breakfast on the boat every morning was the highlight of our stay. "
"fantastic stay! great location, awesome accommodation, wonderful host. definitely highly recommended. "
"flip was a great host! he accommodated us coming early and leaving early and it was so helpful! the breakfast he served was delicious and well thought out. the houseboat itself was lovely. we went in september and be aware that there are a lot of spiders around that time in amsterdam but they are harmless (coming from someone who hates spiders) and none were inside the houseboat. the shower was better than i expected for a houseboat and was very refreshing with good water pressure. the toilet space is small but to be expected for a boat. the location is perfect. super close to a bus stop and the bus system in amsterdam is efficient. the bikes provided by flip makes you feel like a real local. there is a small pier so that the houseboat feels more private and isolated while still being close to the main road and i loved that. overall, an excellent stay and i highly recommend this place. "
flip & marjan were great. flip helped us get a feel for the area and some awesome places to eat and shop. when we had to leave he helped us get a cab to get to the airport which was a tremendous help. would definitely recommend! 
a perfect place to stay when exploring amsterdam. close to the central train station and cbd. the two bikes help to reach the hot spots which are a little further away. flip is an excellent host. the breakfast served every morning in the room is very good. 
"loved our stay on flip's canal boat, perfect for a couple. we arrived early, well before check-in time, but were able to settle in right away. breakfasts were amazing, such a treat to wake up to each morning. the boat's notebook suggested a handful of good restaurants nearby, we sampled two of them, and they were wonderful. so nice to be able to walk home from dinner. quiet, restful, and excellent location. we took full advantage of the two bikes, perfect working condition, and would have taken out the canoe, but the weather turned before we could. all in all, it was a fabulous place to stay in amsterdam, and we'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
we arrived late in the afternoon and it was easy to locate from the central station. the place is easy to find using (hidden by airbnb) maps. the area is very secure and easy to access using taxi or bike or by foot. 
wir hatten ein fantastisches wochenende .das hausboot liegt super zentral .perfekt mit den beiden fahrrädern.flip hat uns verwöhnt mit einem tollen frühstück.
"unique experience. we loved it. traditional dutch breakfast was freshly made and delivered to us every morning. good location, within walking distance to everything. flip is awesome! "
"absolutely loved our recent stay and trip to amsterdam, nothing better than waking up with a view of the water and a perfectly made breakfast.    by far our best experience on airbnb and cannot recommend flip and his houseboat more.    "
"the place is very close to the main station, a bus gets you there in no time! a 10-15 minute walk from the boat brings you to a bubbly lively area full of cafes and restaurants. it's very quiet, particularly cosy when rain drops fall on the boat - like camping, just a lot more comfortable! the place is equipped with everything you need, clean and nicely furnished. make sure to take the canoe out if the weather agrees and swap trams and busses for flips bikes! all in all highly recommended! "
very quaint and convenient to a bus stop
"this was such a unique and fun way to experience amsterdam. the location near the central train station and access to the bikes made for speedy travel. and even though the location was close to the center of amsterdam, the boat was peaceful and serene.     breakfast was generous, and the hard boiled eggs were perfectly done. the centers had were solid, but still just a bit creamy. we were so full from breakfast that we skipped lunch most days.     flip was always available for questions, and his knowledge was very helpful in planning our trip around europe. "
"flip's houseboat was a wonderful find! we were just minutes away on bike from the center (with two bikes he provided us). staying on the houseboat was super cozy and a very unique experience! the breakfast was absolutely delicious and he even accommodated some of my dietary needs which was nice! eating breakfast on the boat, with the comfy robes he provided us was one of the highlights of our trip. he was also very accommodating with check in times. there were a lot of little nice details which made our stay a lot better! i would definitely recommend and stay here next time! thanks flip "
we had a wonderful and unique experience in amsterdam staying on flips houseboat.  the location was within close walking distance to the city center but away enough for a quiet and peaceful stay.  waking up eating breakfast in such a tranquil place on the water with beautiful views was an amazing way to start each morning for us.  flip was always available to answer our questions and help us find our way around the city.
"our stay was outstanding, the houseboat was so quiet and relaxing, the neighborhood safe and interesting, close to amsterdam central and surrounding area full of interesting shops and eating places. flip was an awesome host, unobtrusive but very welcoming and responsive. the breakfasts were delicious. we will definitely come back.    "
my husband and i stayed on flips houseboat for two nights. we had a really lovely time. the weather was really cold during our stay and i was worried the boat would be cold but it was very cosy and warm with the heating on. the apartment is small but perfect for two. the bed is very comfortable. we slept so well and woke to a lovely breakfast each morning. it was a great start to our day! we didn't use the bikes as i found amsterdam city too busy for cycling but we reached everywhere by foot. 
"we really enjoyed the two nights we spent on flip’s boat and didn’t want to leave! it is such a wonderful, unique space and so well equipped that it soon felt like home. we slept incredibly well in the comfy bed and enjoyed the breakfast very much. i would definitely recommend flip’s boat to anyone who is looking for somewhere quite unique to stay when they come to amsterdam. "
"good location, but also very very quiet. great to have bikes ready for us. three ovens makes it hot even in wintertime. great breakfast. 2x bathrobes makes it seem like a spa. should bring own slippers. flip is an interesting guy, good conversationalist, even heard him practice singing with his family which was nice. "
"just amazing place, great location "
"we had a fantastic time in flip's boat. it was warm and very comfortable. and as everyone else has said, the breakfast was the highlight! would recommend this for you stay in amsterdam. "
flip's place is such a cool and unique place to stay while in amsterdam. it's nice and quiet on the boat with a short walk to the main canals. the boat is well stocked (had extra power converters that we needed) and the breakfast every morning was wonderful.
"we loved our first visit to amsterdam (january) and this property was a perfect place to stay. it's located in a lovely and quiet area which is not too far to walk to the central parts of amsterdam.  flip is very friendly and the breakfast he brought for us each morning was generous and healthy!  there are a lot of houseboats to choose from but i'm extremely pleased with my choice to stay on the ms luctor and would be very happy to stay again! we chose not to use the bikes or canoe on this visit but we'd love to try these out on another visit, perhaps when it's a little warmer.  if you're looking for somewhere to stay for a cosy, romantic getaway then you won't be disappointed if you choose to stay here. "
"breakfast is good but very small, not worthy"
"we enjoyed our stay at flip's houseboat a lot. it was unique, had great views, comfortable, and breakfast was just amazing."
breakfast every morning was great! 
"the accommodation on the ms luctor is very warm and cosy, even when it snowed outside.  it's a very clever use of space across the 3 decks/floors.  the bed was very comfy, the shower nice and warm & we were made to feel welcome by the host.  the breakfast is very good and plentiful...more than we could eat in fact.  i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."
thank you for the wonderful 3 nights in your amazing housboat. it was exactly as it was descibed.  we were sincerely received. the breakfast was fantastic. there was nothing missing for us.  thanks for everything.  hille & tom 
"what a great place to stay! we've visited amsterdam a few times before and this was the best accommodation by far!   apart from being a beautiful boat and a superb place to stay, the breakfasts were amazing and the location is perfect - we even walked from the central station easily (but we were travelling light).   flip was the ultimate host and really looked after us too - i'm sure we'll be back!"
very lovely and comfortable houseboat in a quiet neighbourhood. a huge and delicious breakfast on the morning. not far from the central station and public transportations. bicycles availables to enjoy amsterdam like the habitants. the perfect original place to stay for a calm and cosy stay !
great experience on flip's boat! lovely breakfast and fantastic nearby restaurant and bar recommendations. 
"we had a wonderful stay on the house boat. it was so much more than we expected, even better than the photographs portray.  the bed was very comfortable, the heaters worked very well. flip was a great host, he brought us a beautiful breakfast each morning.  to have the use of two bicycles was great. the house boat is very close to the center of amsterdam but far enough away to be relaxing. i would highly recommend flip and his wonderful house boat to everyone visiting amsterdam! evan and shebael ireland"
"flip ist ein toller gastgeber auf einem wirklich schönen hausboot, das fantastisch gelegen ist! "
"very comfortable mattress and pillows, good space, very quiet and save, good internet, relaxed host and good breakfast. would certainly stay again and recommend, although tall people (>180cm) might struggle with the bed. "
"great experience living on the houseboat. flip is a great host, and provides very good breakfast as part of the stay. "
fantastic place to stay while in amsterdam! the breakfast is amazing and the location is an easy walk to everything. the host answers questions quickly and makes the stay wonderful!
"we had a fabulous time on flip's lovely boat. breakfast each morning was excellent, and the location very close to activities and things we wanted to do. flip even went out of his way to deliver an item to us that we had left behind after checking out - quite an exceptional host!"
"we had a wonderful experience staying on the boat for 5 nights. the boat was cozy, clean and very comfortable. it's only a 10 minute walk from the tram station and closer to restaurants a taverns.  as someone said to ""how amsterdam""  to stay on a barge house!  we would definitely stay again."
terrific house boat..
what a wonderful experience staying on a canal boat! we loved biking all over amsterdam! the boat was clean and cozy. the breakfast was delicious every morning! thank you flip!!
"i had the most incredible stay at flips houseboat. i love that the area was very quiet, but also easily accessible to all of the downtown places. waking up on the water is such a wonderful experience and flips breakfast selection was very enjoyable while taking in the view. definitely recommend dinner at daalder, just a 10 min walk away. "
"ms luctor is a beautiful converted dutch barge in a very picturesque and quiet area of amsterdam. it is situated within easy walking or cycling distance of all the sights and makes the ideal base for a holiday in the city. the barge is very comfortable and cosy and gives one a sample of houseboat life. flip, the owner, is the perfect host, very welcoming and friendly. each morning he delivers a breakfast basket full of delicious food which really sets you up for the day. we had a fabulous holiday here and cannot recommend this property highly enough."
"we had a fabulous anniversary visit to amsterdam on flips houseboat. communication and check in were excellent, the houseboat is cool and has more character than a posh hotel. its an easy walk into town and flip also provided us with a lovely breakfast both mornings. thanks again flip and we'll see you guys next  year! "
this is a great location and close to everything. the boat was comfortable and clean. it was such a special way to spend our 2 days in amsterdam. flip was great and gave us privacy but also was helpful when we asked for tips. i would highly recommend. 
we enjoyed our first houseboat stay and our first visit to amsterdam. the location was great because it was quiet yet only a short bike ride to the ferry or shopping. i am heartbroken i have to leave such a wonderful country but will be back soon i hope. 
"es war eine absolut toller aufenthalt und eine wunderbare zeit in amsterdam.  wir haben uns auf dem hausboot rundum wohlgefühlt. besonders zu loben ist auch das frühstück, dass jeden tag liebevoll vorbereitet und von flip gebracht wird. vielen dank für alles! wir kommen auf jeden fall wieder! "
flip's boat is a cozy little spot that is great for a couple. he provided a delicious breakfast each morning. we will definitely visit again if we return to amsterdam.
flip was a very nice host and the breakfast was amazing!! thank you for the nice week! 
great location - easy to get to the downtown area. clean and comfortable stay. cannot wait to go back for another stay!
"really nice houseboat in a peacefull neighbourhood. flip is a perfect host, serving a really nice breakfast "
"bucht das rundum wohlfühl-programm bei flip! dieses boot ist ein wunder der gemütlichkeit und hat so viel persönlichen charme. außerdem gibt es alles, was praktisch und angenehm ist. dieses boot ist nicht nur hübsch, sondern vor allem auch sehr durchdacht-intelligent eingerichtet. wir sind verblüfft und voller bewunderung. die lage könnte auch perfekter nicht sein. wunderschöne umgebung und gleichzeitig ein katzensprung ins zentrum. die krönung ist schließlich das grandiose frühstück und die mittel zur fortbewegung inklusive. und ganz besonders der so sehr sympathische gastgeber. "
"we loved staying on flip's boat. the location was great and it was easy to get into the centre of town from there. flip provided a brilliant breakfast every morning that set us up for the day.  in particular, the freshly squeezed orange juice and still warm boiled egg were lovely touches.  even though the boat is only 15 minutes walk from the central train station, the location was very very peaceful and quiet. the westerdock bar around the corner (3 minutes walk) was very friendly with a great bar lady.  highly recommended! "
"wir hatten ein wunderschönes wochenende hier verbracht. das hausboot ist der wahnsinn, so durchdacht und schnucklig klein... mal was ganz anderes! obwohl es mitten in der city ist (paar min. mit den coolen fahrrädern und man ist in der stadt) ist es relativ ruhig dort . 15 min zu fuss zu central station (bahnhof). das frühstück hat wirklich ein extra grosses lob verdient! wir könnten immer draussen frühstücken bei herrlichem wetter und tollen ausblick! wir würden auf jeden fall wieder kommen 100% weiterempfehlung !"
"what an amazing spot!  flip's place is everything you could want from amsterdam.  the location is slightly off of the main tourist area so you get to be around locals and have some peace but are only a minute or two from a faster pace. your also right near one of the free ferries that takes you to northern amsterdam, so convenient!  flip went out of his way to make me feel welcome.  he gave great local spot recommendations and even gave me a rain jacket the day that i got to see the ""real"" amsterdam (aka ""wet"")  the breakfast he served each morning was a feast!  i felt very spoiled sitting by the water eating delicious treats.  i'd recommend this spot to anyone! when i come back to amsterdam i will be sure to book here again. thanks so much!"
"great houseboat, location and breakfast. flip is a fantastic host!"
"das hausboot ist sehr authentisch, minimalistisch eingerichtet. ruhig gelegen zur belebten innenstadt kann man sich den sonnenuntergang am steg ansehen. flip ist sehr gastfreundlich und bringt jeden morgen frühstück mit frischem o-saft, müsli, käse+wurst. zur innenstadt sind es mit dem rad (zur bootbuchung inklusive) ein paar minuten-perfekt wer nicht zu fuß gehen möchte."
"a lovely, super-tasteful boat in a great location - a short walk from the centre of amsterdam but in a quiet dock. the breakfast was delicious and very generous and flip very friendly and informative. it was really useful to have bicycles to get around town, though a bit scary riding as we are not used to reverse pedal brakes and the huge numbers and speed of other cyclists. the nearby part of central amsterdam is absolutely beautiful."
"great little houseboat on the canals. cozy quarters, but comfortable and with a great host."
"you cannot go wrong here. flip is an amazing host and the bikes he provides allow you to see all of the city in such a short time. there is a great grocery store just down the street if you need anything. if you haven’t been to amsterdam start here. it is a place that is just minutes from the city center. also, the breakfast flip provides is incredible. you are not going to find a better value and hospitality in the city."
"flip was very nice man. breakfast was imazing. i recommend this place, it was amazing enjoyment."
flip's ms. luctor ist eine außergewöhliche und außergewöhlich schöne unterkunft. alles ist bis ins detail sehr liebevoll eingerichtet. die lage ist hervorragend. fahrräder inklusive sind super. das frühstück ist ebenfalls besonders. und flip ist ein toller gastgeber. alles in allem ein wunderschönen rundumpaket!! wir haben für 2 euro den p+r parkplatz sloderdijk (oder ähnlich geschrieben) genutzt und sind ganz bequem mit dem bus 22 dort hingefahren... renuka und michael
"flip’s place is conveniently located, for easy access to amsterdam. being on a houseboat, will be a memorable and unique experience. the quarters are very clean and flip provides a substantial breakfast spread. the pictures are accurate, however the space is quite small. kitchen and laundry facilities are not available, there is a laundromat within a 10min walk and there are many good eating options around, be prepared to eat out every night though."
we had a wonderful stay on flip’s houseboat!  all the reviews about flip’s hospitality were so true and he proved to be the most kind and generous host.  the breakfast was wonderful and since we stayed pretty busy and made very early starts on most of the days on our trip flip was kind enough to make a special trip to provide us with some sandwiches to keep us fed on our journey.   i cannot express enough how grateful we were for his hospitality.   as for the place it is perfectly as described.   temperature dropped to just at freezing on our trip and we were worried that the boat would be cold but the heaters kept the space cozy and warm.  the bikes were a wonderful amenity and we made use of them to get around the city which was very helpful.   the space is wonderful and comfortable but is quite cozy.  it’s big enough for a couple to exist comfortably but you should be very comfortable with your partner as it is a pretty tight space.   that being said the bed was surely one of the most comfortable in all of my airbnb experiences and we slept great while there.   overall this place is highly recommended.
"amazing 3 days spent on flips boat. it is truley stunning and unique. the breakfast is fabulous. location perfect, to see everything the amazing city has to offer. would definitely recommend! just fabulous "
"beautiful houseboat at a great location. the breakfast each morning was amazing, quite possibly our favourite part of our stay!"
"flip's houseboat is a wonderfully unique place to stay, and in particular we loved using the two bikes which flip kindly provides with the accommodation. eating the delicious breakfast provided each morning overlooking the canals is another memory we will treasure. thanks so much for your warm hospitality!"
fantastic place to stay and great location. easy walk into the centre and the boathouse was so cute. would return and recommend.
"perfect, unique home away from home. location is amazing, walking distance to everything yet still private, cozy and safe. flip is an amazing host, quick to communicate and the morning breakfast is an awesome touch. we love it!"
un séjour magnifique et un accueil très chaleureux. loger dans une péniche -et celle de flip est vraiment splendide- donne une dimension incroyable à la découverte d’amsterdam. un mode de vie à découvrir en tous les cas! merci flip
besonders der ausblick durch das bullauge vom bett aus ist fantastisch! 
the houseboat is centrally located walking distance to the train station and right downtown amsterdam...being on one of the canals was very interesting and the houseboat experience was fun...flip is a wonderful host....the morning breakfast was very special!
"dear flip, what a beautiful boat! thank you so much for your incredible hospitality.  breakfast was super amazing!  we are going to miss it here very much. ross has especially enjoyed waking up on the water and becoming friends with the ducks. we will definitely be coming back.  have a wonderful christmas and happy new year and see you soon. ross and teri, bristol uk."
"wir sind flop sehr dankbar, dass er sein außerordentlich schönes plätzchen mit gästen teilt. sehr gerne kommen wir wieder, am liebsten im sommer, um die tollen zusätze wie fahrrad, kanu und tisch am steg zu genießen zu können. aber auch das schlechte wetter war nur halb so schlimm, weil wir uns an der mollig warmen heizung und einem heißen tee schnell wieder wohlfühlen konnten."
"if you are coming to amsterdam then you have to stay on flips boat. all the amenities of an apartment or hotel. hot shower, comfy bed, good heat, and an amazing breakfast included. very very clean and flip is very thoughtful in the things he leaves in the space for you to use. two free bikes as well, hard to beat everything that is included. location is easy to get anywhere in a hurry as well, 5 min bike ride to central or anne frank house."
flips home was a great place to stay to get the full amsterdam experience. the boat was so much fun and within walking distance of most things we wanted to see. breakfast was great too! would love to stay again.
"i must say that this was a very unique experience.  the room is nice, the bed is absolutely comfortable, the breakfast was delicious and flip was a very friendly and nice host.  i was a bit worried about staying in a boathouse during winter but it was nice and warm.  i  absolutely recommend this!"
"great location not far from central station. ceiling on boat might be a bit low if your really tall. bikes made everything available within minutes. very quite and private, safe area for walking day or night."
a very extraordinary place in the middle of amsterdam. very cosy and nicely done house boat with love in the details. a perfect place to spend a few day's with your beloved person in the middle of this pulsing city.
"wow. is all. staying on ms. luctor was the perfect way to spend a mini break in amsterdam. there is so much we could say about it but you really need to discover it for yourself. our highlights were eating delicious breakfast whilst sat in the cabin overlooking the canal, the use of the bikes to explore the city, and being able to come back to somewhere warm and cosy after a very cold day. thank you flip - i hope we get to come back one day!"
"we had an amazing time in amsterdam and flip’s boat was lovely, the breakfast that was left every morning was very generous and delicious. would recommend to everyone."
staying on the boat was such a novelty. the breakfast which was delivered to us every morning was outstanding. lovely quiet location but very convenient to the city by foot !
"a great place if you want something a little different. warm, cozy, and a full breakfast. would highly recommend."
"une perle! la péniche de flip est l’endroit parfait pour visiter la belle amsterdam. par sa localisation, ses petits « plus » (vélos, guides à disposition...) et l’endroit en soit est juste parfait pour vivre la vie à la hollandaise. nous espérons pouvoir y revenir!!!  merci flip!"
wonderful stay and a great experience. book it!
a fantastic and slightly quirky place to stay in amsterdam.
"flip’s houseboat was amazing ! great location, charming and flip was a wonderful host providing us with information and a scrumptious breakfast! what a delightful stay !"
"just like the reviews we read, the place was a great place to spend our days in amsterdam! very novel, very romantic, and flip our host was extremely hospitable, friendly and helpful. the breakfast is tasty and fresh (freshly squeezed orange juice!) and can fill you up till the afternoon! we enjoyed ourselves very much!! highly recommended!! only one tiny detail- very tall people should consider that the ceilings are limited, they may have to bend over a bit, and bathroom a bit narrow. but otherwise, fantastic place!"
endroit atypique avec beaucoup de charme idéalement situé dans un quartier calme mais proche de la gare et du centre ville. flip est un hote attentionné qui vous apporte le petit déjeuner tous les matins. la hauteur sous plafond est basse et à prendre en considération pour les personnes de plus 1.80m.
"we absolutely loved our stay on the boat. fantastic view while having the excellent breakfast, everything clean and super comfy. short distance to the central station and a bus station, short walk into the city centre. flip was such a gentle person. everything has been perfect!"
"flip was de perfecte host en ons verblijf was heerlijk! de boot is prachtig, de locatie is erg goed gelegen met een super leuk uitzicht tijdens het ontbijt. tijdens onze eerste volledige dag hebben we gebruik gemaakt van de fietsen. enorm handig om amsterdam mee te verkennen! we zullen zeker overwegen om nog een keertje terug te keren naar deze b&b bij ons volgend bezoekje aan amsterdam! flip, erg hartelijk bedankt!"
"great space, very clean and comfortable! great breakfast included and bikes being included was an added plus."
the views of the canals from the barge are wonderful. the best part is having the amazing breakfast in the wheel house and enjoying the view each day. flip's place is a must for a true taste of amsterdam.
"super tolle unterkunft, klein aber fein. morgens aufstehen und dein frühstück ist schon auf dem tisch herrlich. das bett super gemütlich. die lage mit den fahrrädern erreicht man in 10min. die innenstadt."
einfach nur perfekt!
"wonderful location a comfortable walk north of train station. great atmosphere on the water. was quiet, even friday and saturday nights. flip provided delicious breakfast each morning; more than we could possibly eat. the space was great. bed was so comfortable. great shower and all exceptionally clean. stay on flip's boat for a unique amsterdam stay."
"emplacement parfait, 10mn a pied de la gare centrale; le bateau est situé dans un endroit tres calme; rien a redire sur le logement , tout est parfait comme sur les photos. le petit dej est impeccable et apporté vers 8h30 dans la cabine, libre a vous de le prendre plus tard. nous sommes arrivés a 08h00 et en accord avec flip,  nous avons  pu disposer de suite du logement;  les velos a dispos sont un plus, nous sommes à 5 minutes du centre et parfait pour se deplacer dans tout la ville.   nous ne regrettons pas notre choix, c etait parfait"
"flip's place was amazing!!! if you are looking at any other apartment or house boat in amsterdam just stop and book this one now!  the boat's location is outside of the city center which is great for peace & quiet.  his boat itself is super cute and perfect for a couple!  just a small note: i'm 5'4 and my boyfriend is 6'.  i  could easily stand on every level, but my boyfriend had to slouch a little on the first floor where the steering wheel is and on the bottom where the bed is.  that was no issue though since we didn't spend a lot of time in there anyway and he could stand in the middle floor if he needed to :)  three concerns you may have that i had:  1) the shower is great/like a normal shower, including water pressure  2) the toilet is like a normal one as well ( a little loud if you flush at night and your partner is a light sleeper) 3) even though you're on a boat, you can't tell. aka you shouldn't get ""boat legs"" or feel nauseous  aside from the location and the boat itself, my other absolute favorite part was the thoughtful  breakfast he provided every morning.  everything was delicious and it was so amazing and convenient to have it just ready for us every morning so we could get our day going asap!  he's very considerate of your privacy and makes sure the time he drops off the breakfast works for you.   he also provided two bikes which was incredible.  we literally took them everywhere.  the only slightly negative thing i can say is the girl's bike/smaller bike was a little squeaky/old, but it worked just fine!   there was also a super close bus stop, but we never used it aside from when we first arrived.    another side note: if you get back late/want to stay in, ubereats delivers there as well :)   i hope i didn't leave anything out!  i would 100% stay there again for a future visit, and hope that i can!   seriously! book this now!"
"wonderful place, great setting and fantastic hospitality. quiet at night and very comfortable stay with a lovely breakfast in the morning. being able to bike around amsterdam on the bikes supplied by flip definitely made our weekend! "
flip's place was exactly as described and amazing! we loved riding the bikes around amsterdam and enjoyed waking up to a lovely breakfast basket from flip. would highly recommend staying here and is also in a great location :) 
"our adventure started with a no fuss check in, a casual bike ride (on flips free use bikes) to the local store for cheese, crackers, wine and tapenade to settle in for our first evening on a gorgeous private little jetty overlooking the canals to enjoy our local feast. we were joined by flip during the evening. he ensured we were checked in and comfortable and answered all our questions about the local attractions with warmth a smile befitting a generous host. nothing was too much trouble and flip even put the canoe in for us on the morning of our departure for a last minute paddle. the location is ideal. close enough to the city to walk but far enough away to be peaceful. can't recommend enough."
"great breakfast, use of bikes and beautiful stay."
our stay on flips canal boat was amazing. the location is so close to the center of amsterdam. we had use of bikes and a canoe which was an awesome way to see amsterdam. flip was helpful and friendly.  breakfast was amazing.  thanks for the memories.  
"wow!  our stay was the best part of our stay in europe. quiet and beautiful with an incredible host.  it was a 10 minute walk from the train station, and very easy to find.   the space was unbelievable.  there was more room  than we had anticipated in the shower, bedroom and lounging area.  breakfast was waiting for us each morning with the option of eating inside or out on the jetty.  what a great way to start our days of touring the city.   s we highly recommend flip's place.  10/10. thank you again flip!"
fantastic experience. wonderful breakfast. unique and special accommodation.
stay here! it is an amazing place!  so close but just far enough away to relax! the bikes are so very helpful on getting around town. flip is a thoughtful and caring host!  thank you 
"we had an amazing time. the houseboat was charming and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, especially the fresh breakfast waiting for us in the kitchen every morning! "
flip was very  helpful and  considerate  of us and our allergies.  he was great to  chat too as well . will  definitely  stay again  at this  romantic  house boat
"this boat is a gem. it is on a quiet canal only 15 minute walk to train station. flip is a great host.  he brought a wonderful breakfast basket every morning with fresh breads, cereals, yogurt, and fresh squeezed orange juice. check in was easy and the boat and bed very comfortable. flip even printed our shuttle voucher to our next connection. the boat had a nice shower and coffee and tea maker. the dock was great for sitting on by the picnic table and it really feels as if you are living here. we even met his neighbour who is an eel fisherman. we would highly recommend the ms luctor!"
flip's houseboat was an amazing way to stay in amsterdam. the breakfast each morning was incredible. the location was great (close to centraal station). the space was very comfortable and clean. i would recommend staying at flip's place.
best   -airboat+breakfast- you'll ever stay at!
"this is a fun way to get to know amsterdam.  an authentic houseboat, great location, really great breakfast every morning, and flip (host) who is there to help with questions and special considerations making sure you have a nice visit."
"great location, lovely boat with a great breakfast. close enough to walk to central station and there is a team stop across the dock."
highly recommend this place. it’s a 12min walk to center town. quiet and beautiful
"we loved our stay on the ms. luctor.  residential area, beautiful views, quiet, cozy and clean.  flip was a wonderful host  and the information (and breakfast) were so appreciated and wonderful.  this is true amsterdam and devoid of all tourists. perfection."
"amazing houseboat in a quiet location that is perfect for exploring amsterdam! the attention to detail, bikes  and breakfast made this even better than we had imagined!"
excellent place to stay in amsterdam. the boat is nice and clean! the breakfast really good. we really like it :)
an absolutely fantastic place! beautiful boat and surroundings. great location! would definitely recommend this! outstanding!
"super cool place and host!  if i ever going to amsterdam again, i will definitely stay at flips houseboat again.  i recommend it for anyone!"
flip's houseboat is phenomenal. we absolutely loved our stay here and the only complaint was that we didn't have a longer stay booked in amsterdam to enjoy it longer. we were a short walk to the center of town but far enough away that it was quiet and peaceful. the breakfast provided was top-notch. flip is extremely kind and when we come back to amsterdam we will definitely make it a point to stay here again.
great houseboat - lovely quiet location but not far from the action. flip was very responsive and helpful. great having the bikes on hand - loved using those. we would definitely recommend this place to our friends.
"we loved our stay on the boat, so cosy and such a great space, the breakfast was a special touch. 20 minutes walk max to most places we wanted to go. would definitely stay again"
a quality establishment - perfect in every way - the breakfast was something else!
"flip's houseboat was a great place to stay in amsterdam. it was a fun experience staying on a houseboat, and everything about staying on flip's was ideal. flip was a kind host, the breakfast was great, the space was welcoming, and the location was nice. i highly recommend staying here!"
prima plek! het gebruik kunnen maken van fietsen is ontzettend fijn! we hebben genoten en komen hopelijk nog een keer terug!
"we had a superb stay. the houseboat was quirky and charming. flip was a wonderful host, who provided lots of great local recommendations. we want to come back soon!"
"tout est en accord avec l'annonce. le logement est propre, bien situé, agréable. le petit déjeuner est parfait et copieux. flip est très réactif. je ne peux que recommander."
"a unique experience staying on flip’s boat. good location, easy access to the city. flip was a good host, warm and welcoming, nothing too much trouble.   bed was sooo comfy! wonderful breakfast, freshly prepared each morning."
"in amsterdam i got live on both a boat and an apartment. if i were to do it again, i would choose the boat. the location is amazing and the boat is really cool. it has everything you need, including a private bathroom with a shower. flip is a really accommodating host and did an awesome job with breakfast. the boat is really close to the main city where everything is happening. if you would like to amplify your amsterdam experience, come stay at flip's place."
agréable séjour dans un lieu sympathique et cosy. quartier calme  avec des restaurants de qualité à proximité. centre-ville rapidement accessible à pied. flip est disponible et son petit-déjeuner est très appréciable !
very nice place near to the center but more quiet !  very very nice home ! and very very nice person ! thank you michele (and patsy ;)) !     gwen
nice apartment with very good connections with the centre or train station by tram. we enjoyed our stay there for sure.thank you michele  iratxe and aritz  july 2010
it was a great idea staying at michele's home! very nice house and close to the city centre! delicious breakfast and very kind telling us great places to visit. if you have the chance to visit amsterdam and need accomodation don't think twice and contact him.       
michele was a gracious host.  his place was conveniently located near trams & buses and it was a very easy commute into the central area of amsterdam.  the apartment was very well maintained and impeccably clean. his cat is very sweet too. a great place to stay.
"this was a room that got sorted out at the very last min. so a big thanks to michele for helping me out. he is a very polite host. the room was great, very neat and tidy and the rest of his apartment is the same. would recommend highly"
michele was a fantastic host. perfect spot near the center but with local flavor. helped us find a local cafe to enjoy a drink and also made breakfast. thanks again!
"michele was a great host! very friendly, welcoming and hospitable - and puts on a great coffee in the am! many thanks again my friend."
"michele was a great host.  the apartment snd room was very clean.     the apartment is conveniently located with lots of trams and buses nearby, we found it very easy to get around.    we would strongly recommend staying with him. "
"wonderful apartment. it is easy to get to and it is very clean and michele is a very thoughtful host. he has a beautiful kitchen and the bedroom is great. michele makes everything spotless. my wife and i had an excellent stay. a big thanks to michele. highly recommended. we will stay again when we visit amsterdam, that is 100% for sure. "
"many thanks to michele as he was a great host! the rooms and his appartment were very clean, tidy and the location was easy to reach from the center..recommended to everyone.."
"michele hosted 3 of our family members, including an old aunt, who might not have been the easiest guest on earth :). this was my (and their) first airbnb experience, and definitely a promising one!  michele's apartmant was tidy, and as he wasn't at home at the time when the guests arrived, he gave the key to us a bit earlier, and showed everything in the flat.  he emailed me to check if everything was alright, and whatever i mentioned, he quickly adjusted.  they had a great time, and said that they would certainly recomend his place. the only negative fact they mentioned, is that the apartment is somewhat noisy even at night as there's a busy road at front of the house, although ofcourse it's not his fault,  but part of city life :)."
"michele's place was perfect for our weekend stay in amsterdam.  his apartment is clean, comfortable, and very easily accessible by public transportation (both day and night).  he was very hospitable; he helped us find directions and get oriented in amsterdam, and even laid out breakfast each morning.  "
michele is a great and helpful person. his apartment is really nice and his breakfast is delicious. i just can recomend his place. thank you michele and patsy!
thank you for the breakfast and the tips michele.  it is a good choice pick this one :) ... 
"michele's apartment was clean and tidy.  michele was a great host, very generous and helpful.  the location was very accessible and easy to get to the center of town.  i would recommend staying there. "
michele was a wonderful host.  the room was clean and lovely he left us a great little breakfast for us in the morning and has a super cute cat!!!   thanks michele!!!
"we had a great weekend in amsterdam, michele is a great host.  had breakfast ready when we woke up every morning.  we had a great time and is a great location.  trams are in front of his apartment."
michele was a great host! he made me feel very welcome and would highly recommend him as a host for anyone wanting a good place to stay in amsterdam. the breakfast in the morning was wonderful. thanks michele! 
we had a great experience in amsterdam and the stay with michele was good. his apartment is lovely and was easy to get to on the tram. breakfast ws ready for us when we got up and was very nice. michele is a very friendly person and a good host. we would recommend a stay with him and would stay at the apartment again 
"cosy room. good location. helpful host! perfect accomodation, especially for cats lovers =).    "
"the location is not in the heart of the center, but public transport is next to the apartment and it can take about some 10min to reach the center (or about 20-25 by foot). next to the apartment is a supermarket and a place for parking. the host is very friendly and nice, so in case i will be in amsterdam again, i'd stay there again :)"
michele was an incredible host--very respectful of our space (it felt like we had the apartment to ourselves!) and left a nice breakfast for us every morning. the rooms were very cozy and comfortable and incredibly clean. it was very easy to get into the city center with the trams that stopped basically right outside of his apartment. we would definitely stay with michele again if we go back to amsterdam!!
"yes, it was a very nice homely experience with an equally caring host.  we look forward to meet him again.  himanshu & chandrakala joshi,"
had a great stay at michele's house.     the place is nice and well equiped. it's not center city but honestly well located as closed from the centre and the major parks by bike.
"michele is vern nice and hospitable. his place is centrally located enough so we had no problem walking thru--out the city.     we came planning to cycle in holland, so we brought our hybrid trek cycles. although nearly everyone in amsterdam has at least one bike, they do not leave good cycles on the street. the city also has one of the world's highest theft rate for cycles.  michele rents out two rooms.  as the other room was vacant, he suggested we place our bikes in it.     the two flights of steps up were narrow and extremely steep. my wife would not have been able to get her bike up or down by herself.     the bedrooms are very small, yet have storage for your clothes.     "
"the place was great, nice bed, the kitchen was fully equip, the living room is beautiful. michele is a great host, giving us good info. have a nice cat to accompany, makes the place more lively as michele has to work. worth staying and will definitely come back to stay."
we had a very nice time at michele's house. his house was very clean  and i could not tell enough about the pillows and mattress they were super extra confortables. he was so kind to us he even let us a delicious breakfast every morning  and he has the sweetest cat we have ever met.  we would love to stay with him again. thank you michele!!
my sister and i enjoyed our stay at michele's house. the room is a bit small but exremelly clean.  michelle was a great host and made a delicious coffee on the evening we arrived.   the flat is in a very quiet location and is withing easy reach from the town centre.   the breakfast is small but i believe michele did say that on the website.   i strongly recommend those rooms in amsterdam.  cheers!
"michele's place was very nice!  we were there for two nights, and we felt very much at home.  he provided a yummy breakfast each morning, including pastry, coffee, and juice, and we were able to do laundry before we headed to our next destination.  he was also very accommidating to our travel schedule.  he met us during his workday to give us a key and pointed us to the correct bus stop to find our way to his place.  the location is a bit outside of the city centre, but the bus and tram were easy to navigate, and the walk was only about 25 minutes.  we would definitely recommend him as a host!"
"staying with michele was a warm, friendly and cosy experience. the apartment is really nice and clean, the mood is very friendly, connections to downtown are great (even just walking isn't too bad) and michele is a great host. the room was small, but functional - as expected. i wish we had more time to hang around with michele. it was all in all a great and all positive experience and i would highly recommend it."
"we had a wonderful time.  the apartment is lovely and michele has a beautiful companion, patsy, a chocolate siamese! it was great to have comfortable beds and cotton sheets after hostel beds.  and a washing machine to catch up with clean clothes!    we recommend this to anyone visiting amsterdam, but be aware there are 2 flights of narrow steep stairs.  michele was home when we arrived and acted as porter for his 2 (older) guests.  thanks michele."
"the apartment is conveniently located near the central area, needing only around 5 tram stops. the place is clean and well maintained, although the stairs up to the apartment is very steep! there is also a kitchen which we were allowed to use. best of all, michele provides breakfast every morning!"
"the apartment is as described and shown, cozy and welcoming. at times, it felt like we were the only ones around, even though michele was present in his own room. he was very welcoming and patient with our two young kids. the tram stop to dam square is a short walk from his block, and there are a handful of eateries around the corner too. the only slight inconvenience is that the apartment is on the third level up stairs that have small steps, so it can be a slight struggle if you have plenty of heavy luggage, like we did. overall, we enjoyed our stay here, and would return if we are ever in amsterdam again."
"nos encanto quedarnos en el piso de michele, el piso muy limpio y comodo, tuvimos nuestro propio espacio que para nosotros es importante, no está centrico pero en 15 minutos ya estás en el centro y me encanto el gato :)...lo recomiendo..."
"michele welcomed us in a very friendly manner on the night of our arrival. he had organised breakfast for us and he left us his home as he was leaving on holiday himself. so, the whole flat was at our disposal which was enjoyable in a way although we did regret not to have a couple of chats with him about amsterdam way of life or dutch social issues. patsie is a very friendly pet and as a cat lover i loved cuddling  in the evening after one day visit in nearby amsterdam center.( very convenient to reach thanks to public transport or after a 30 mn walk)"
"lovely place, warm and friendly - and with a lovely cat. we felt very much at home and would stay with michele again. highly recommendable. "
"michele's apt is conveniently located in the west part of the city center. from his aprtment, it only takes 2 min. walk to tram 14 and 5 min walk to tram 13, both go to the dam square and central station. the apt is very clean and has the facilities you need. michele is a very easy going fellow and he made us feel home. thanks for the breakfast for us each morning. one thing to keep in mind that there is no elevator in the apt. you do need to carry your luggage to the 2nd floor. "
really nice place and a very good host! in a part of amsterdam that is close to the center but far enough to get away from tourism. michele was a very kind good host that treated my friends and i very well (and gave us breakfast in the morning! very kind). thank you!! 
my husband and i had a wonderful time staying at michele's place!  such a great location as we became familiar with amsterdam.  michele was a great host providing yummy breakfast for us each morning.  would highly recommend!
had an awesome stay with michele! he is accomodating and always available for assistance and the apartment is very cosy. michele was also kind enough to let us use his washing machine and dryer. i would definitely stay here again on my next trip to amsterdam. good job!
"we had a great stay at michele's place. easy access to the tram if you want to go downtown or go back to central station, the 12 and 14 trams are right outside, with 13 and a few others a block or two walk away. there is a grocery store about 1 minute away as well. the flat was awesome, really clean and michele was very generous, wish we could have seen him more maybe, but he gave us our space which was nice too. "
we had great time. thanks michele!
"michele was a great host, and very helpful. his tidy and cozy apartment was conveniently located to anywhere we wanted to go in amsterdam, by tram, bus, or walking. and of course, there's michele's siamese cat, patsy, the queen of her domain, is a delightful addition for cat people.  "
"good location, very convenient. we did not had a chance to meet the host.  he let us stayed as the dates we booked and give us detailed check-in infomation.  we really appreciated."
i stayed with my girlfriend for 3 nights and we had a great stay. nice room in an apartment which is near the center of amsterdam. michele prepared a little breakfast every morning. i would return to micheles place anytime.   thanks a lot    
"my wife elena and i, we stayed with michele for two nights and we really enjoyed his hospitality. michele is easy going, flat is clean, michele provides tasty basic breakfast and place is located 15 minutes tram ride from the city centre - what else can you wish for this bargain price. you will surely get used to michel's friendly cat."
"it was my first time staying with someone via airbnb and i cannot recommend it enough. our host, michele, was very friendly, answered quickly to enquiries, kept everything tidy and clean and served us a small breakfast every morning: in general made us feel welcome. the location itself is easy to reach via public transport. all in all, i can definitely recommend this host. thanks again !"
we were very comfortable staying with michele. his apartment is lovely and beautifully decorated and our room was very pleasant. we had two single beds and they were so comfortable. we slept very well. we especially liked patsy the cat! what a sweety. michele was very kind to leave breakfast treats out for us in the morning and we were pleased to have use of the coffee machine as well. overall we were very happy with our stay.
"we enjoyed the stay a lot! amsterdam is a very nice city! with friendly and beautiful people.  the location of the flat is great. next to the canal and a park. around you can find a lot of shops, cafes and etc. good district!    the flat itself is very cozy and nice with a gorgeous cat! she is the cutest animal on earth :) and of course the owner is kind, friendly and helpful!   our trip was wonderful! we rented bikes and it's took us just 10-15min till dam! jola & irene  "
michele is very nice and served up breakfast. it is very quiet and quite the place.
"we had a really nice stay by michele, who supplied us a lot of informations, small breakfast, coffee or tea, quiet room, near to the center and a gorgeous friendly cat!!! thank you, it was really nice!   julien and marta"
"it was an amazing time in amsterdam! michele is a great host, very friendly and open. the location is also very good - not noisy but close to the center of the city. highly recommended! "
"this place is great!  we really enjoyed our stay.  michele is a great host, with the perfect amount of assistance and respect for privacy.  definitely will stay here again when returning to amsterdam!"
michele was really friendly and his place is really confortable and just couple of blocks from the city center. i strongly recommend michele's venue.
"michele is a great person, we felt really comfortable with him around, he helped us out with the directions and places to visit, very clean place and respectfull with our privacy! the tram is a couple of steps away from the door and a supermarket just around the corner! great time"
"everything was great! the rooms were clean, comfy and quiet. ok. you here the tram and cars a little, so if you like absolute silence, you have to choose another room.  michele is a nice and absolutely uncomplicated host, who hleps you with everything.  would choose it for my next stay in amsterdam."
michel is very nice. the second room is perfect for a couple. have fun. louis & diane
"my stay with michele was great. the whole apartment was extremely clean and i felt very at home! the location is super convenient - anywhere you would want to go is a really simple tram ride. although i didn't talk to michele very much, he seemed very kind and hospitable. and his cat is beautiful, sweet and very social! overall a great stay, i would highly recommend it. "
"we had a great time at michele's place. the two rooms where perfect for two couples, the whole apartment was perfect and clean. michele always had some coffee and breakfast roles for us. if we come back to amsterdam we would definitely stay with michele again. also his gorgeous cat patsy is a big plus factor ;-)"
test
we couldn't be more pleased with our stay at michele's place. very clean and he even treated us to a small breakfast to get the day started.     will repeat.
michele is a great host! we had a great stay at his home!
best value for the price. michelle has very friendly cat but it may be disadvantage to some people with allergy. interior very clean. location only 15 min by tram from the very center but not noisy. breakfast included! 
"you could easily stay in a hotel in amsterdam that would cost more, and still not be as nice as michele's place.  the location worked out very well for us, with a convenient tram stop right across the street.  the neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe (even late into the night).    the breakfast/coffee that he provided was very convenient and saved us some money.  he was also flexible about check-in and check-out.    highly recommended!"
"very pleasant and clean apartment, really not far from the center of the city once you are on a bike!! :) "
"awesome host, awesome apartment! thanks!"
"we stayed at michele's for 2 nights and we had an excellent experience. not only was michele a great host  (he was very nice and welcoming), but the room was very clean and very comfortable. his apartment was only a minutes walk from the bus stations and his cat was so adorable and friendly!    the only downside that i can think of, is that the stairs leading up to his apartment (2nd floor) is pretty steep so it was a little difficult to get up and down with large luggage (but this is just a nit picky bit of inconvenience).    we would highly recommend this place and would have no hesitations in staying again!"
"my boyfriend and i stayed with michele for 3 nights and had a brilliant time. michele's place is spotless and is beautifully decorated. the room we had was super cosy and the bed was very comfortable. we enjoyed playing with his very social and beautiful cat!     michele was very helpful with regards to public transport and recommended the best way of getting around. he even printed a map for us. the apartment is literally across the road from the bus station which will take you to the centre of amsterdam in no time. we also found it easy to walk to the centre (about 30 minutes), which we preferred as you get a great feel of amsterdam and you will pass many great pubs and bakeries. overall we had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend to everyone."
"nice rooms in a clean, quiet, very nice apartment. only took us about 20 minutes to walk into the center of the city. definitely recommended."
super wochenende und tiptop saubere zimmer! würde ich immer wieder machen.
"il proprietario è una persona davvero disponibile e discreta, l'appartamento è molto carino e pulito e in ottima posizione da cui ci si puo'  facilmente muovere sia con diversi mezzi pubblici sia a piedi.  esperienza assolutamente consigliata!!!  "
my wife and i stayed with michele for three nights and had a great time in amsterdam. michele was a very gracious host and his cat is a real lover. tram and bus access are very close and provide easy access to the rest of the city.
michele was very nice and accomodating for our visit.  he provided us with a light breakfast each of the two mornings we stayed at the apartment.  he was also helpful in directing us on how to get to the airport from his apartment.  his cat is also very cute.  i would certainly recommend the apartment to anyone looking to stay in amsterdam.
"i stayed at michele's with my girlfriend for 2 nights and i must say his apartment is pretty nice, the room and especially the bed was very comfortable, :). the flat has got wi-fi, which is always a plus nowadays and he was so kind to offer to let me print some festival tickets i'd forgotten to print before traveling, which i really appreciated, as not everyone is so kind. he also filled me in with the best ways to reach the centre of amsterdam and if i may advise, the best option is to take bus 18 from and to centraal station as it takes about 10 minutes overall, which will make you feel like you are not far at all from the centre. definitely a really nice stay and i would recommend to anyone who is not too fussy about staying exactly in the centre. plus he will also get you some breakfast every morning, something that i have never had before with air bnb hosts, :p."
oll was wery good!
"michele was great! he had some breakfast rolls for us each morning and had tea bags/coffee for us to use. everything was clean and very tidy.  unfortunately, i also realized i had was allergic to cats when i stayed here. haha, my fault! but the cat was very cute and friendly. the location is very close to all the action; it was about a 15 min train ride to amsterdam central."
very nice and clean house & michele is the best host 
very nice and clean apartment. michele was very cool about check in and check out time and we really appreciate that! 
"michele was a great host. good location on a tram line direct to the action of amsterdam. michele's place is in a quiet neighborhood with amenities right at your doorstep. large bathroom, super comfortable bed, great coffee machine for the morning.  wicked stairs to get into michele's place but i am sure that he would be willing to help carry your bags but most homes in amsterdam have these staircases.  i would recommend michele's and of course stay again if i am ever in amsterdam. also a very friendly, adorable cat!"
"we had a fantastic experience staying at michele's place for 9 days. his apartment is immaculate. his cat, patsy, is sweet and enchanting. the beds were very comfortable, and there was a dresser and closet in the room. the juice, coffee and melkbroodjes supplied for our breakfast were delicious. the neighborhood was great. the erasmuspark, right down the street, was beautiful. we enjoyed a music festival there. the trams and buses are right outside, and the walk into central amsterdam is only about 35 minutes. there are plenty of cafes, shops and grocery stores nearby, including the lovely outdoor cafe in the park. michele's communication was blindingly fast, which was a great comfort. we would not hesitate to stay at michele's place in the future. dankjewel, grazie, michele!"
great stay thanks michele - a really enjoyable place from which to experience amsterdam. michele was very friendly and accommodating. thanks!
"we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in amsterdam. michele and his siamese cat, patsy, made us feel welcome, but also allowed us our privacy. i would recommend staying here to anyone who can climb 2 flights of stairs. this was a great introduction to my first visit to europe."
"michele was a very kind and courteous host, he gave us much information about the city and how to get around and good things to see.  he lives in the apartment so checking in and out were a breeze and we could do them at our convenience.  his cat was absolutely lovely, we actually spent a while one night just playing with him.  apartment was very clean and organized, and had a large nice bathroom.      all was a great experience , would strongly recommend!"
"michele is a superb host--friendly and accommodating, but not obtrusive. i'm not sure i realized i would be sharing the apartment with him, but it turned out amazingly well.  i especially enjoyed the presence of ""putsy"" his adorable siamese. "
"nice home, clean and equipped.  michele is nice and friendly.  the cat is adorable.  awesome experience in amsterdam thanks michele."
"we felt like home at michele´s apartment. he was very nice and the house it´s good and well located. there´s a very good supermarket near the house. we have rent a bike, so it was only 10 mins cycling to the center... on a nice neigborhood with some beautifull ""canals"" around.  highly recommended! "
"he is a really good host, preparing breakfast for us.. really have good opinion in food, love chit chat with him. assist us calling the cab. and not to forget his lovely siamese cat, very adorable and welcoming.  about the house, very clean and beautiful as in the picture. near to the tram stop, just walking distance within 1-2min.   the stairs to his house is steep, however he doesnt mind helping us. thanks a lot michele! we really enjoy our stay at your house. "
"a very cosy, well equipped and well situated apartment. moving from the dam as well as commuting to schiphol was a breeze as the tram station was a stone's throw away from the apartment.    both michele and his siamese cat was very friendly and accommodating. truly a great and friendly host as he was pretty cool about the check in and check out times.    just a word of caution though, stairs leading up are steep. got quite a shock when we saw it as we were carrying quite large luggages as it was the end of our europe trip. seems like most houses in amsterdam are like that. so just take not and travel lighter.    all in all, a truly great apartment and will definitely stay there again if we do visit amsterdam again. thank you michele for your hospitality."
"although we didn't have much contact with michele due to our short visit to amsterdam, i'd highly recommend him as a host. his apartment is close to the centre, it takes circa 10 minutes to get to the centre by bike. he is ready to help you, whenever you need him and the breakfast was fine. thanks michele."
"michele is wonderful person and his place is very clean, comfortable and wonderful. we enjoyed our stay in his place and enjoyed the neighborliness of quite friendly cat.  thanks for his hospitality.  hovhannes."
michele was a gracious host and his place is in a nice location that is not too far from all the attractions. 
our stay in amsterdam was short but very nice. michele made it really uncomplicated as i admit that we arrived pretty late on friday (thanks for being at home that evening/night!). he´s very sympathatic. the place was cosy and good lacated for us! and his cat- it´s cute :-)! 
"michele is an excellent host with the best and most detailed information available from the time you read the listing. it was a lovely and comfortable stay with all the necessary comforts, public transport in close walking distance and a supermarket just around the corner. michele and his co-host, the lovely cat patsy, were both very friendly and welcoming. "
"michele was a very kind and accommodating host. my friend and i had a late arrival in amsterdam, but he didn't mind us checking in much later than usual, and he gave us all the necessary information about the place once we got there, even though he was sick at the time. he is very helpful, and the place is very nice and comfortable."
spent two nights here and it couldn't have been better. michele was really accommodating and very helpful. the apartment was great - very clean and exactly as described. i would totally recommend it.
michele is reserved but nice. accomadation is as described. i recommend. 
amsterdam is a diversified and cool city and it can really easily be explored from michele's flat. he is quiet but nice and very helpful. clean rooms and all one needs for a holiday trip. you even get a small breakfast :)
michele is a very nice and helpful host. the apartement is near to the city and very comfortable. a metro station is just a few steps away. we had a great time there. thank you!
"at the first time to used airbnb website,i had an excellent few nights with michele and pretty (gorgeous cat ). the location is nice ,near to the park and easy to find from the tram,michele was very kindness and helpful ,we had a delicious cake for breakfast ,you can use the kitchen that make us can have some tea and had relaxing time !"
"i like this apartment. really - near city center and very easy to get. supermarket was close. the owner was friendly and helped us :) though i tortured him with questions :))))  thank you for all, michele! "
"nice place, good location.  "
"michele is a very nice and helpful host. the room is a little small, but is ok if you don't have a lot of luggage and just need a place to rest. the bath and the kitchen are very clean. the localization is good. for us it was perfect. "
"very nice host, small but clean room, very clean bathroom, comfortable beds, sweet cat. we really liked it and higly recommend it! "
this is about my first airbnb-experience: i've been in amsterdam for a few days with my 15 years-old daughter. michele was a very friendly and respectful host (it felt like we had the apartment to ourselves!) and he left a nice breakfast for us every morning. the rooms were cozy and and very clean. it was easy to get into the city center with the tram and the bus that stopped basically right outside of his apartment. we would definitely stay with michele again if we go back to amsterdam!
"glad to choose michele's house to stay for 3 nights with my mother.  the apartment is well located, tram stop in front of the build, or about 25 min walking to the city center (a easy and lovely walk). close to markets, bars and a night club.   nothing to complaint about our stay. was a perfect choice, especially because of the price and privacy that we had. all the hotel and hostels was so expensive usually in a not good place and with nothing else than a bed! michele's offer us a simple and good breakfast. with milk, juice, bred, coffee ... delicious! wi-fi working perfectly. very comfortable bed and hot shower! the only not good point is the stairs, that is very step but not a big deal, specially in amsterdam where every single place is like that. just be patient if you are carrying a big luggage, you can be in a (small) problematic situation for few seconds because there's no lift in the building! :)   michele was a nice guest and helped us with the directions and places to go. he was very discreet and sometimes we even met him, looks like was just me and my mun staying in the flat. his cat is lovely and very curious about the moves in there, like all cats.   a great first experience with airbnb.  thank you so much michele  "
"michele was very kind, and we had very good time during our stay.  a clean and nice place to stay, very very close to bus and tram stop to get centraal station, dam square, museum district etc.  thank you michele, hope to see you later"
"michele's place has the most comfortable bed i've slept in on the road! the apartment is about a 10-15 min tram ride into the city center which means it's very quiet at night making it the perfect retreat after a long day! if you don't like taking public transportation then you may want to stay somewhere closer to city center. i must admit the bus/tram lines can be a bit confusing. also, his cat potsie is super friendly and sweet. coffee in the morning was a major plus! great place, i highly recommend it!  "
i enjoyed the stay at michele's place throroughly. he's a nice and polite host. and his place is in a good location and very clean. i highly recommend his place if you're in amsterdam. 
"very friendly, very easy & close to the city :)"
"l'appartamento è in una ottima  posizione, collegato benissimo con i tram x raggiungere tutti i luoghi piu interessanti della citta, inoltre è molto confortevole e grazioso, michele è un ottimo padrone di casa!!! ;) baciiii"
"michele was a great host. he helped us find our way around amsterdam and was very accommodating when we asked for help with anything else. the room was small but clean and comfortable, and it was nice to be able to use the kitchen and living room."
"we had a fantastic time with michele, very accommodating, great location, clean room and a friendly cat. thoroughly enjoyed our visit to amsterdam."
"our stay with michele in amsterdam was very pleasant. the apartment was just outside the city center, in a quiet neighborhood. the apartment was very clean and michele was very accommodating. his cat is very cute, friendly, and curious! "
nice place! close to everything!! had a good time:)
very nice and calm place in amsterdam.
great place to stay. michele is very friendly and the apartment is close from the city center. i'd recommend it. 
"michele was very helpful and informative,    apartment was close to transport, was a 5 - 10 min bus or tram ride to city centre.    clean, tidy, a recommended stay."
"it was a nice location, easy to get around.  the room was nice and clean. morning coffee and brioche were a great addition."
"michele's apartment is as described and close to charming downtown amsterdam. just a ten minutes bus ride. me and my three friends have enjoyed staying with michele. he is a great host. everything is in best order, shower with plenty of hot water, the beds are very comfy, the room a bit small (dutch style), so are the steep stairs. there is a nice coffeeshop in the neighborhood for breakfast. great place to rest when you spend a weekend in amsterdam."
"l'appartement est bien situé, tram et bus très pratiques juste en bas. les chambres, elles, sont petites et assez bruyantes mais propres. notre hôte a été très discret, nous aurions aimé échanger davantage avec lui. une bonne adresse quand même !"
we stayed here in high summer. the flat was as described and comfortable. michele was a good host and the cat was very friendly. highly recommended.
michele was a very helpful and welcoming host. we really enjoyed our stay at his flat! we could walk everywhere and the house was clean and cosy! definitely recommended! thank you! 
"micheles place war great - very tidy and comfy. it is a bit smaller than it looks on the pictures, but still we felt very much at home staying there...also the tram is just across the street - so it was very easy getting around...  unfortunately we didnt get to know michele himself as he was on vacation as well, but he organized a friend who was very friendly and helpful...  cheers veronika"
lovely stay in amsterdam. the apartment is close to the centre by tram and everything is in easy reach. rooms and apartment are well supplied with everything needed. great communication from michele and a lovely welcome. 
the problem was that there was no way to take the garbage out and on a hot day the smell from the trash can was very strong. that created the impression. we cooked but did not dip fry. maximum effort was made to clean the apartment. terribly sorry for the bad impression left.
very nice apartment and host. we loved every thing. i certainly will recommend.
we had a great stay in amsterdam. the apartment is well located it was clean and michele was available at every time. 
"the place is good and cozy, very close to the old town and city center..  michele was very professional and welcoming, also he had a very nice cat.  if i am going back to amsterdam sure this place will be my choice."
michele was a very good host providing a clean room and easy access to facilities which made us feel at home. . great to be able to use his wifi which he generously made available free of charge.  shirley & janine
michele had a very clean place and was very nice.  he provided us with information about the public transportation and some knowledge only the locals would know.  i would highly recommend him!
"exactly as promoted on airbnb.  michele was a lovely host who understands travelers needs.  helpful but not intrusive in our comings and goings.  it was great to have access to a kitchen and laundry facilities. easy to use transit system from this apartment, so while it is a little bit away from the center of the city, it is easy to reach all the major tourist sites.  apartment is quiet; beds are comfortable.  we recommend this location to other travelers. "
"we had a great time at michele's. easy to get to. the rooms were both a decent size. i wouldn't recommend it for an extended stay, but for a couple days in amsterdam, it worked out great."
"michele est très arrangeant notamment pour l'heure de notre arrivée (merci à lui) . l'appart est très agréable, à 15 -20 min du centre et le bus vers le centre ville est au pied de l'immeuble. seul bémol : la chambre donne sur la rue et elle est un tout petit peu bruyante mais rien de bien méchant. . si vous avez l'occasion apportez vos rollers et n'hésitez pas a faire la rando roller du vendredi soir en nocturne (friday night skate). un agréable séjour à amsterdam notamment grace a michele. "
"the host was very nice and kind, the apartment clean and cozy, but very noisy with cars almost 24 hours, which made it hard to sleep with a window open, for those who suffer from hot temp at night.    part from that, very nice stay."
"friendly and affable host. clean and comfortable room. convenient location - on public transport, you can quickly get to any point in the city. recommended."
"hello,    our travel was very good, we enjoyed the week end with a lot of fun.  amsterdam is really a city to go with friends, girlfriend and also (website hidden by airbnb) many things to do !!    michele was very friendly and sympatic. thank you and see you soon :)    "
very nice host recommended to everyone !
this trip was one of the best airbnb experiences we have ever had. the apartment was super clean and tidy. michele is an obliging and very friendly host. thanks for the free breakfast! it was a pleasure to be his guests.
"michele's apartment was clean, cosy and in a good location. i can definitely recommend staying here. also, he is kind enough to provide breakfasts including use of the espresso machine!! "
" michele was very friendly and simpatico. he's apartment is clean, quiet and comfortable. it's easy to go to the city center. thank you for your breakfast everyday. 房间干净整洁,也还算安静｡去中央车站需要换一车,坐12路可以直接到梵高博物馆,14路可以直接到伦布朗､水坝广场｡几乎都在10-15分钟左右到了｡公寓旁有超市,michele还提供早餐,,很喜欢他家的猫,挺有意思的!"
my mother stayed at michele's apartment for 3 days while visiting amsterdam. michele was very welcoming and his cat patsy was adorable!  
"an excellent host, location is great, and the room was comfy! definitely recommended. "
we had a great stay with michele. the apartment is lovely and in an excellent location-we were able to walk everywhere. he left us doughnuts for breakfast each morning and we were able to use his expresso maker. we also loved his cat! i would recommend staying here. 
"we stayed in the room with the double bed which was comfortable and had a wardrobe to store our things. the apartment is nicely furnished. michele arranged for us to leave our luggage in the apartment on our departure day as our flight was later that evening. michele provides breakfast which is great - tea/coffee, orange juice, milk brioche. if you are a light sleeper ear plugs might be a good idea - having said that, the noise level isn't too bad. it is easy to reach the centre using the metro/trams or else walking which takes 25 minutes to the anne frank house and 30 minutes to dam square.."
"posizione comodissima,con tante linee di tram e bus che in pochi minuti portano al centro,casa pulita  e tranquilla.  ci siamo trovati bene,consigliatissimo  luca"
"nice flat, close to the city. "
"everything perfect, the house was very clean, we took the separate beds room which is right in front of the entrance of the house so it's very comfortable for everyone. the neighbourhood is close to leiseplein, just what we were looking for. i recommend this house to everyone !"
nice location. clean room and bathroom! had a good time with michele.
"so clean room and good location( by tram )! and then not noisy!    specially, patsy is very cute and friendly :)"
"the room and bathroom were clean. the beds were good and the location not too noisy. michele was friendly and easy as a host. only the breakfast was a little weak, just coffee and brioche. so that could be optimized:) cheers annette "
"michele is such a gracious host. he is very thoughtful in laying out everything that one might need, including staples like coffee and tea, and providing advice on how to get around. we stayed a number of days which were pretty busy because of a conference, but he was always available if we had any questions."
"we had a nice stay in micheles house, he was a great, uncomplicated host. the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom were very clean, there was enough space for both of us. there is a small supermarket and the bus station next to his place. next time we go to amsterdam, we would like to stay at his house again!"
"clean apartment, close to the center ( 30 min walk or 15 min with the bus) and well equipped kitchen.  the little cat was very attached. "
"my friend and i had such a great stay in amsterdam! the location was great (conveniently close to a tram stop), michele was extremely friendly (he had coffee, orange juice, and brioche buns for us every morning), and the room was plenty of space for the two of us. thanks so much michele!"
"the best thing about michele's house was that it was like being at home away from home. room was clean and spacious, toilet was impeccably tidy. patsy the cat was such a charming host as well. the house was slightly outside of the city centre but reachable via bike/bus/ tram. the tram/ bus stops are only minutes away from the house. highly recommended."
we had a good time staying michele 'a house. he helped us to print out some train tickets. and never got annoyed when we came back late:)) he prepared for us breakfast everyday and you can just have time for yourself. tidy and clean. nice connection with tram. 15 mins from train station. 
"my daughter and her aunt enjoyed the stay in this accomodation very much - small but very cosy, clean - and michele is a very nice host. thank you for the good time they had in amsterdam! and a special kiss from emilie to the cat..."
"nice experience, the host is a friendly and affordable person. patsy is very very cool cat. meow. i would definitely get back in ams and stay there again."
"michele was very kind and cute :) the (website hidden by airbnb) clean,  clean!!! perfect i really appreciate him"
michele est un hôte discret et serviable et son compagnon chat très câlin. son appartement coquet et très propre est situé dans un quartier plutôt calme à 6-10 minutes du centre ville en tramway ( l'arrêt du tramway est quasiment au pied de l'immeuble ). la chambre que nous avons pu choisir est accueillante et bien isolée du bruit de la rue. a recommander.
stayed here for 3 nights. michael was very prompt in his replies and everything is as advertised. gave us a short tour around the house and everything went swell. thanks for hosting us. also patsy the cat was such a wonderful roommate. would certainly recommend michael's place for anybody wanting to visit amsterdam.
lugar súper tranquilo y cómodo
michele is a very nice host! strongly recommended! he also has a very beautiful and talkative cat :)
"we were well welcomed by michele and patsy, his lovely cat! he is a nice person and very kind. the apartament is well located and close to public transport and very organized. we loved to stay with him and his cat! "
estuvimos muy a gusto en nuestra estancia en amsterdam. la casa es muy agradable y está muy bien comunicada. michele es un gran anfitrion que nos atendió perfectamente siempre que lo necesitamos. altamente recomendable
"flat very cosy, well located, well served by public transports.  breakfasts were good.  we really enjoyed our stay in amsterdam."
michele has been a great host. his apartment is clean and enabled us to visit amsterdamwith ease.
"la experiencia en la casa de michele fue buena. la casa es muy linda y limpia, la habitación es cómoda y michele es muy amable. el barrio es un barrio tranquilo, que si bien no está en donde se encuentran la mayoría de las atracciones turísticas, está a unos minutos en tranvía (pasan varios por la esquina de la casa).  también puedes ir desde la casa de michele caminando hacia la parte más turística y mientras aprovechas el paseo por las callecitas mirando los canales no te llevará más de 35 minutos (caminando lento). el barrio tiene supermercado, farmacia, bares y demás servicios cerca. también lo bueno de la casa de michele es que ofrece desayuno y realmente te lo da!! no es un desayuno continental como si fuera un hotel, pero tiene café o té, jugo de naranja y pancitos.  ah me olvidaba! michele tiene gato pero no molesta para nada :)  "
"michele war sehr nett, wir kamen eher früh am morgen an und konnten unser gepäck schon in der wohnung lassen. es war alles sehr sauber und wir haben uns wohlg gefühlt."
"michele (and patsy his awesome cat) were very welcoming. our rooms were in good condition, and we had delicious espresso each morning! he even assisted us with laundry while we were there. i definitely recommend staying with michele."
michele was a great host! very communicative and helpful
"michele was a polite and quiet host. he was welcoming and had very needed information about the local transport and getting around. his cat, patsy was a great house mate. the local area felt safe and it was located close to transport and shopping."
michel is a good host and his cat patsy is lovely. we stayed in the room with two twin beds and it was just right for our needs (two young people traveling). michel was respectful and helpful and sharing his apartment was a positive experience.
"our stay at michele's was absolutely wonderful -- it truly made our experience in amsterdam that much better! the place is situated literally about 20 meters from the tram stop (jan van galenstraat stop) of tram 14 (which takes you to the city center in 10-15 mins) and tram 12 (which takes you to museumplein where the rijksmuseum is in also about 10-15 mins). the nearest supermarket, albert heijn, is also conveniently close by -- about a 2-3 min walk. michele was kind enough to provide milk, orange juice, some tasty bread, and access to his nespresso for breakfast. the bed was super comfy, and the place was overall very clean and organized. oh, and what else can we say about his cat, patsy, other than she is absolutely the sweetest, most playful cat we've ever met! we miss her!!    we absolutely recommend michele to anyone looking for a well-located, clean, and comfortable stay in amsterdam. thank you so much, michele! we wish you and patsy all the best :-)"
michele is very polite and helpful. he made us feel home very quickly and the room was clean and cozy. he was very willing to give us information about traffic and tourist spots. and patsy was a lovely cat! 
handy place to stay. has easy bus and tram travel into many parts of the city. the cat is one of the cutest cats ever. room is quite small and because it was the middle of smear we had the window open and the trams are quite loud. my partner was unwell and michelle prided us with some tablets to help her get well.
"appartamento molto bello, pulito e situato vicino alla fermata del bus 18 e dei tram 14 e 12, tutti mezzi che arrivano nei punti importanti della città. michele e la sua gatta patsy sono molto ospitali e gentili. appartamento consigliato per chi vuole sentirsi a casa"
"that was a nice stay. the flat is very clean and well situated close to tram and bus and only 30 min from the center. michele is a kind host, discrete. we had a wonderful time there.  "
"the apartment is very nice, clean and cozy. the circulation to the scenic spots is very easy also.michele is a good landlord, it gave us much space to eat and live etc. my friend and i like much his cat,it's very cute!;)  thanks!"
"amazing! the location was easy to find. the room was so cute and clean. the cat made us smile every morning. michele prepared everything you need, from towels to travel information. he was such a nice guy, we were very lucky to find his room just before flying to amsterdam.  "
"das zimmer war recht klein aber gemütlich. da wir uns aber nur zum schlafen dort aufgehalten haben, war es okay. die wohnung war super sauber und dank unmittelbarer straßenbahn haltestelle gut gelegen. zu fuß ist es allerdings zu weit ins stadtzentrum. wir hätten uns ein etwas größeres frühstück gewünscht, denn ein kaffee + milchbrötchen sind ohne weitere zutaten sehr wenig. michele war in der kurzen zeit, in der wir ihn gesehen haben, sehr nett zu uns. "
everything was fine and without any problems. the flat is as described and in a good location. the room is cozy and clean. michele was very nice and helpful. 
"michele war von anfang an sehr hilfsbereit. kaum kam ich an, hatte er mir schon einkaufs- und einkehrmöglichkeiten genannt. generell hatte er immer ein offenes ohr. natürlich war seine katze 'patsy' auch ein highlight von amsterdam ;)   das zimmer war sehr sauber und das bett gemütlich. toll war es auch, die küche und das wohnzimmer nutzen zu können. der wifi-zugang hat mir vieles erleichtert."
"michelle is a good guy, he is so welcoming, the most important thing is his house is so nice, it's clear, quite and tidy, not far from city central and its easy to find it. i like the way he treat my friend and me, fell free like home. michelle, thank you very much. i do like your living room, even though i did use that. hope you have a great life. enjoy it. "
"convenient to the airport. close to the center, within walking distance. cozy lounge and room. communicating with michele had no problems. close to the bus and tram stop, supermarket, playground. apartment windows overlook the intersection, which interesting to watch) the apartment clean, with modern and big bathroom and fun cat). a good choise to stay in amsterdam. thank you michele!"
michael was there when we arrived and settled us in.   he provided information re transport and gave us maps. the location was good and the address was easy to find
"wir hatten einen sehr schönen aufenthalt bei michele! :)) es war alles sauber und ordentlich und die wohnung sieht noch schöner aus, als die bilder es zeigen. michele war sehr freundlich und hat uns das gefühl gegeben, uns zu  hause fühlen zu können :)"
great location ~~ the room are very nice and clean. pasty is soooo cute :)
"estuvimos en uno de los cuartos del piso de michele por 2 noches, el apto esta bien ubicado, pero no tan cerca del centro caminando, como a unos 10 min en bus. el apto es igual a lo que muestran las fotos, un baño grande compartido para 2 habitaciones, y buen desayuno!  michele es muy amable, siempre estuvo dispuesto a responder nuestras preguntas!"
"la descrizione dell'annuncio era precisa e veritiera. l'accoglienza di michele è stata gentile, cordiale e disponibile, avendoci dato indicazioni utili su come muoverci per la città con i mezzi e consigli su cosa visitare  e come visitare amsterdam. il quartiere è tranquillo e facilmente raggiungibile con un solo bus o tram. il soggiorno è stato piacevole, la stanza può risultare un po' piccola ma la casa è curata e pulita. michele è una persona discreta e patsy è un gatto adorabile e affettuoso che non reca disturbo. consiglio questa esperienza! "
my friend and i had an awesome experience in amsterdam. michele and his cat patsy were very welcoming. the flat  is clean and beds are very comfortable. location is perfect. would definitely stay here again!
"michele was kind, and very helpful. the room was small, but perfect for the needs of myself and my friend. the place was clean and the beds extremely comfortable. yes, the street is a bit busy for an open window, but with a pair of ear plugs (i always recommend them to new travelers) i slept great. the kitchen had everything we needed and he even provided me with soy milk as i'm allergic to dairy. his cat patsy was an utter delight, even my friend who was traveling with me, and who not a big animal person, enjoyed her company."

3박 머물렀는데 주인분도 정말 착하고 방도 화장실도 정말 깨끗하고 좋았어요. 관광하기에 교통편도 괜찮다고 생각해요 :) 고양이도 사교성좋구 귀여워요. 
"we had a good three day stay here. the flat was just as described, the beds comfy and the location perfect for our needs. "
"與市中心的交通算是便利 ,房間很乾淨,房東雖然沒有與房客有太多互動,但房東可愛的貓 patsy代他招呼房客,早上在餐廳自助食用房東準備的簡單早餐,patsy就坐在我的身上陪我吃早餐和工作,是一個溫馨的選擇!"
"michele's house is well ubicated. although is not at the city centre it was nice ridying our bikes to dam square for 15 minutes. the room was fine but quite small, although the bed was very comfy. the house was clean and we enjoyed the breakfast at the sunny living room. we hardly spoke to michele since he was normally in his room but he was polite and kind with us."
"posso confermare quanto affermato negli altri commenti. michele è molto ospitale, la piccola patsy una coccolona. la casa è comoda e molto ben collegata giorno e notte."
"michele always replied very fast and efficiently. finding the apartment wasn't a problem at all. from amsterdam centraal, one should take bus 18 and get off at the jan van galenstraat/admiral de ruijterweg station which is very close to michele's apartment. michele gave us a quick introduction into the apartment and we were happily welcomed by patsy, his very cute cat."
very good experience. 2 perfect days there!
michele was flexible on arrival time as he generally works from home. this was great for us.  he gave us basic information on arrival but then we didn't see him much again during our stay - he was in his room working away. we just did or own thing.   the house was tidy and great to cook in and eat at the lounge room table.  there were maps and info on general city tourist things as well in the lounge.    there are two rooms for rent but there was no one else there when we stayed which meant plenty of space in the flat and bathroom.  washing machine was a paid service at the house.  easy to get the bus from central station and close to some great cafes. we enjoyed our stay.
"great guy, great accommodation and it's not far from the city center. it was my firs booking with airbnb and was a nice experience. "
michele was a great host.  the apartment was just as described.  clean and cozy.  easy access to public transport (there's a tram stop on the street right outside).  i would recommend this place to anyway staying in amsterdam.
"principalmente buscaba un precio accesible, el barrio es normal, se llega rapido con el tram 13, 14 desde amsterdam central, o el bus 18.  michele es muy cordial, lo recomiendo 100%"
"we had a nice stay. patsy, the cat, was lovely. michele was helpful even if he was not at home.   the location is pretty good when you have a car because of the parking p+r bos en lommer. it is quite closed and cheap if you take p+r ticket. you can take bus and tram to go downtown from the parking and the apartment.   "
"staying at michele's place was very pleasant. the apartment had everything we needed during our stay, and michele was very respectful of our privacy and belongings. although we did not see him often, he was prompt to answer our questions and help us out with everything. his cat, patsy, is adorable and welcomed us every time we came into the house too!"
the best thing about this accommodation is patsy the cat - she's absolutely gorgeous. the location is convenient for getting around the city and the apartment is clean and comfortable.  it is a good place to stay if you do not want any interaction with the host and are happy being by yourself. 
"the pictures are very accurate, michele's place is very cosy and enjoyable to stay in. he also has a cat name patsy who is as welcoming as the owner! :)"
"michele fue muy amable conmigo y mi pareja. nos dio las instrucciones necesarias para llegar a su departamento desde la estación de trenes. al llegar nos recibió de manera cálida y nos explicó brevemente el funcionamiento del departamento, esa fue una de las pocas veces que los vimos. nunca nos interrumpió en nada y nos dio la libertad necesaria para sentirnos cómodos y que su casa fuera nuestra casa. nuestra habitación estaba limpia y el desayuno era bueno. el departamento no estaba en el centro, pero estaba bien ubicado. a pocos metros se puede tomar el bus 18 y los tram 12, 13 y 14 que te llevan a todos los lugares más concurridos (centro, museos, atracciones turísticas)."
"michele e patsy ci hanno accolto nella loro bellissima casa. essendo neofiti del servizio airbnb michele ci ha fatto sentire a casa nostra, camera non grandissima ma confortevole, avevamo a disposizione cucina e bagno.  zona ben collegata con vicino fermata tram,e vari servizi.  michele è una persona molto discreta e ci ha fatto piacere.  inoltre è molto disponibile!  sicuramente useremo ancora il servizio di airbnb."
perfect room near city (website hidden by airbnb) very close to tram station.i will come back to live here again.
"lovely neighbourhood in easy walking distance to the city centre. the house is very clean and tidy, just as in the photos. it was a very easy process to book and arrive at the apartment. michele was a very friendly and relaxed host and we had an excellent stay."
"cosy and convenient place to stay. house is clean, all photos are accurate. michele is very friendly and relaxed host, he even provide some food for breakfast that is a good start for the day. michele used to answer very quickly for reservation requests, so you won't wait for an answer for several days.  perfect location: 10-15 minutes by tram to the city centre. tram station in 20 seconds walk. p+r parking where you can leave the car for several days for 1 eur/day is also nearby.  so, it was an excellent stay."
the flat was nice in a very good spot. michele is very polite. everthing was clean.
michele's flat is very trendy and ideal for the tram links into town. supermarket and bakers nearby and all amenities just as described!  most convenient for everything and quiet enough at night.  very comfy bed and lovely hot shower!  thank you for the good nespresso michele!
"michele's cozy guest room made for a convenient stay of several nights in amsterdam. very nice neighborhood; i went for a pleasant walk each morning before having breakfast with my companion and catching the tram up the street each day for adventures in the museum district and the jourdan. the bedrooms were comfortable if sparse, and my companion (we were meeting for the first time) enjoyed having breakfast at the pictured table. seeing the picture brings back good memories indeed.    the high point in our stay was patsy, michele's beautiful and spry siamese cat. what a character!  "
staying at michele's place was really convenient for someone who wants to stay near to the centre of amsterdam but enjoys also the peace and quiet of living a bit further away. the room was nice and clean as was the rest of the apartment. michele gave us some good tips for restaurants near by. overall we had a really comfy stay and i would highly recommend staying there if you are in amsterdam for a weekend like me and my friend did :)
"michele has a very nice and calm apartment just a few minutes from the centre by tram. he's helpful, and he even provided breakfast. the room was small but perfect for us. we had a great weekend in amsterdam and would definitely come back!"
"we had a nice stay.  the location is pretty good, you can take bus and tram to go to the center or walk 20min to jordaan. the room is quiet small and with twin beds but clean and tidy.  nice breakfast and michele was helpful all the time.  thank you."
"michele's flat is clean and not far from centraal station (15-20mn by a direct bus) and 20-25mn walking from jordaan, a pretty district. michele's is a discreet person, easy to reach if you need an information."
"michele was very accommodating - the apartment was clean, tidy and warm. the photos were accurate and michele made sure we knew were everything was in the flat and explained public trasnport etc. sharing the apartment with another couple was a bit hard at times due to limited access to the bathroom. overall a good stay and would recommend. "
molto ospitale e cordiale....casa molto pulita e (website hidden by airbnb) ritornerei
"nice room and good location. it takes only 10 min to city center by tram. michele is a polite and kind person, and provide useful information when we ask."
"l'appartement de michele est très agréable, coquet, propre, fonctionnel et calme. il est facile d'accès par les transports en commun. c'est une bonne adresse pour visiter la charmante ville d'amsterdam. je le recommande vivement.   "
"michele was welcoming and assisted us with our needs.  the neighbourhood felt safe to us and there was sufficient facilities available such as restaurants, shops, transport."
"ci siamo trovati molto bene. michele ci ha permesso di lasciare le valigie appena siamo arrivati dall'areoporto, anche se non era orario di check-in. abbiamo trovato una stanza molto pulita e accogliente. anche il bagno (che usavamo in cinque persone) veramente impeccabile. ci ha dato diverse indicazioni e consigli."
"nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez michèle, hôte discret mais toujours disponible pour répondre à nos questions ou nous aider,le petit déjeuner compris . l'appart est comme sur les photos propre et bien placé, quartier calme, supérette et tram au pied de l'immeuble. et michele à un super chat patsy, joueur et câlin !! je vous recommande l'appart de michèle et patsy."
"強力推薦!    l'appartement est très propre, coquet et bien situé dans un quartier agréable. l'arrêt de tramway 12/14/18 est juste en face pour se rendre au centre-ville, il est sans doute une bonne adresse pour visiter amsterdam! michele et patsy sont super sympas et accueillis. merci de nous avoir beaucoup aidé:)  "
"ottimo. solo una parola....michele ci ha accolti con sobria discrezione nella sua casa, estremamente graziosa. le foto rappresentano fedelmente la casa, accogliete te e comoda. pulizia e cura da dieci.  la posizione è molto buona, a circa 15 min. dal centro (piazza dam) raggiungibile comodamente con tram che passano spesso e sono comodi.  molto comoda la possibilità di utilizzare la cucina per prepararsi una cenetta. è perfettamente attrezzata e michele mette a disposizione quello di cui si ha bisogno...  nei paraggi non mancano locali dove mangiare e bere...  un grazie a michele per averci accolto nella sua casa..."
"the apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood that is at some distance from city centre, but every major point of interest was easily reachable by tram. the room itself was homey and had plenty of space for our luggage. there was a friendly cat in the apartment which would occasionally come by our room. michele was flexible with our arrival time and communicated well before and during our stay."
"the flat is lovely, with a incredibly sweet and mild mannered cat sharing also. everywhere is tidy and clean, and you are provided with towels and storage space, which we weren't expecting. the host was nice, we didn't see much of him because we were out exploring, however he was friendly and welcoming when we met him. the flat is  quite a walk away from the centre, however we used the busses and trams that stop literally metres from the front door. these run at all times of the day which makes it easy to get around. the neighbourhood is quiet with a supermarket nearby, and we felt safe walking there at night (two young women). it would be a pleasure to stay with michele and patsy again!"
"soddisfatte della scelta! le foto rappresentano fedelmente la casa, comoda e graziosa..pulizia e cura da dieci più. molto buona la posizione, 15 minuti dal centro..  un grazie a michele per la sua gentilezza e ospitalità!"
"apartment was very clean and open to our use, and michele was open to any questions we had. our room was private and big enough for the two of us and the unit was in a good location and easy enough to get to from the train station and to the airport!"
"easy to check in, very clean room, enjoyed having privacy, really nice bathroom (big and clean), cutest cat ever (patsy), michele was very easy to communicate with. the whole place is very clean and not cluttered. good location and right on tram line. he provided us with a fan because it was really hot when we visited and it helped keep the room cool! there is a table and some cabinets with drawers which was nice to be able to put our stuff away."
everything worked out fine - a very clean apartment with a nice host! even a small breakfast was provided. quite uncomplicated! location of the apartment is perfect for a visit to the city. 
"c'était notre première expérience avec airbnb et michele nous a donné envie de recommencer! l'appartement est exactement comme sur les photos, notre chambre un peu petite mais ça nous suffisait largement vu le temps qu'on y a passé. le petit déjeuner le matin était très bien. michele est discret et très gentil, il nous a mis à l'aise dès le début, nous a donné des bons conseils et nous a rendu service à chaque fois qu'il a pu. son chat patsy est adorable et très sociable. l'appartement est très bien situé, pas de bruit la nuit, juste en face l'arret de tram et à une 20aine de minutes de jordaan, un très joli quartier. très bon séjour, je recommande très fortement !!"
"the bedroom very lovely and very clean, we have sweet dreams here! the cat patsy also very charming. everything is good~"
"the flat was well located within the city, making it very easy to get around. we didn't see our host much, but when we did, the interaction was always pleasant. the room was clean and the beds were comfortable. patsy the cat was adorable and kept us company when we were at the flat. overall, a good stay."
"michele was a nice host, even though i only stayed for a short time. i did not have many encounters with michele because i was often out of the house, but he was very kind the few times i saw him. the apartment was nice and the room was suitable for what i needed, although fairly small."
"michele nos ofreció algunos productos para el desayuno (café, té, mermelada, pan, etc.) y también nos dejó usar su cocina aun fuera del horario establecido.  cumplió con todo lo pactado en el contrato.  el barrio es muy bonito, muy tranquilo y está bien comunicado con el centro de ámsterdam por transporte público, así como también con el aeropuerto schiphol. "
our stay with michele and patsy was how we expected it to be: really good! the room was nicely prepared and we felt welcomed. michele provided us with every information we asked of him and was a helpful host. patsy was a cute and well-behaved cat who made the stay even better.    linh + paul
"the stay was good . the house is clean, organized and located a few meters from public transport. by walking, 35 minutes from central station.  the beds are ok!  the owner was quite attentive and helped with all the doubts .  recommended !"
it was a welcoming apartment. michele is a great guy! he is very helpful and kind.
"la casa de michele es muy cómoda. pasamos unos días muy buenos y nos atendió con mucha amabilidad. nos ayudó a subir las valijas cuando llegamos y nos dió total libertad para manejarnos en su casa. y además nos brindó un desayuno muy rico. el departamento está cerca del centro y hay paradas de tranvías y buses en la puerta que te conectan con el centro, las estaciones de trenes y el aeropuerto. realmente lo recomendamos. grazie michele!"
"alles war sehr schön vorbereitet, sogar mit handtüchern. wir wurden herzlich willkommen geheißen, michele hat uns alles gezeigt und war für fragen immer da. das zimmer ist gemütlich und alles sehr sauber. man braucht nicht lang ins zentrum. es geht sowohl zu fuß als auch öffentlich sehr schnell.auch im museumsdistrikt ist man sofort. und die katze ist zauberhaft :)"
great place to stay at! michele's apartment is extremely clean and tidy. he even offered us coffee and bread for breakfast. 
"the stay at michele`s house was very good. it is easy to reach the neighborhood. the room is clean, well oranized. the breakfast , light but excellent to start the day: coffee, milk, orange juice, crackers and jam. patsy is like another guest there!!!"
very nice place and close to the city center by bike.
"when we first rode the bus to michele's neighborhood, we wondered if we were in the middle of nowhere! however, the public transportation is so very good, it was no issue. we were very comfortable @ michele's room. the bed & pillow were especially comfortable! the room was basic but adequate. if one has mobility issues, the stairs to the 2nd floor are steep - a bit like climbing a ladder. once we got used to it, not a huge deal."
"ottima accoglienza, host molto disponibile e sistemazione impeccabile. molto soddisfatto"
"michele's apartment was very nice and clean. it's also pretty close to the center of the city and main attractions. there's a bus stop just right  in front of the apartment so that was very convenient. i also loved that the room we got had a walk in closet so we had room to store our luggage.  michele was also a very nice host and quick to respond to any issues. his cat,  patsy was adorable as well!"
we enjoyed our stay in michele ' s place. everything was very clean and comfortable. super close to public transport which made getting around amsterdam a breeze. patsy was so cute and cuddling! !
"host was very kind, and shared his nespresso machine with us! great location and very friendly cat."
"che dire, sicuramente l'ottima accoglienza di michele ha subito reso positivo il nostro (seppur breve) soggiorno ad amsterdam. persona cordialissima, gentile e disponibile ci ha subito consigliato su come muoverci. l'ambiente della camera è semplice, ma con tutto quello che serve (i letti comodissimi!!!). c'è a disposizione la cucina per cucinare e al mattino puoi prendere dei succhi, il caffè, the, e fette biscottate per colazione offerti da michele.  la compagnia della sua gatta patsy dona buonumore fin dal primo mattino.. veramente tanto affettuosa!!!  sicuramente consiglio a tutti di pernottare qui sia per il semplice fatto che è ben collegato coi mezzi sia, e soprattutto, per il bell'ambiente e per la gentilezza dell'host che non possono far altro che rendere ancora migliore la vostra vacanza lì.  grazie ancora!!"
"though we didn't see a whole lot of him, michele was a kind host and easy to communicate with. his apartment is a bit small but it has everything you'll need and is in a great location. just a hop to the tram station and a short ride away from most sites. the apartment is tidy and the amenities work fine. the stairs to the second floor are really steep and narrow so beware if you have lots of heavy luggage! overall it was a great stay and i would stay here again!"
it was amazing his cat was so nice and he was so helpful. it truly felt like a home. 
superbe chambre vraiment à 5 minutes en tram d'amsterdam. michele est très sympa et très discret! patsy adore les câlins et a su nous tenir compagnie pendant nos petits déjeuners ! merci michele pour cet agréable séjour !
"we had a comfortable stay here over christmas. michele is very welcoming and was helpful in guiding us in how to find the listing. the room is conveniently located as there are tram stops a very short walk away direct to the city centre and main attractions, as well as schiphol airport.  the room and toilet were very clean, plus it was nice to be able to keep some of our food in the fridge. his cat is one of the friendliest cats i've met!"
"appartamento e stanza sono molto accoglienti e puliti. la zona è servitissima dai mezzi ed è facile muoversi per la città.  siamo stati molto bene, grazie michele!  alice e danilo"
"michele was a wonderful host. a friend and i were at another airbnb that did not work out, and michele took us in with less than a day's notice. his place is cozy, quiet, and clean, and as others say, his cat is very friendly. michele was very accomodating and helpful. the place is in a great location, with only a 15-20 minute tram/bus ride to many points of interest. we were very pleased with our stay!"
"michele is a great guy, quiet and doesn't bother you at all and he is ready to help you when you need him. beds are little bit small but realllyyy comfortable to sleep in! his cat is cool, you don't see it that much. apartment is clean, we had free coffee and free musli for breakfast. apartment is really near city center and you have tram station just across the street. only stairs in the building are squeeky and really steep and small so it is bit hard to walk on them if you are high haha i loved it there and next time i am going there again! thanks michele! wish you all the best :)"
"nice to have short stay..breakfast is there, just self service. i love his cat.if u have (hidden by airbnb) map and i amsterdam card, its easily for u to his house and everywhere u want in amsterdam. btw michele is nice host. he's quite busy man. couldnt say thank u at the end of my stay...."
"bei michele war es wunderbar. er wohnt sehr zentral und sehr gastfreundlich und vor allem sehr unkompliziert. das zimmer ist sauber und die wohnung top! wir hatten sehr grosse privatsphäre und michele erklärte und am anfang alles notwendige. ein besuch in amsterdam ist immer lohnenswert, der aufenthalt bei michele ist dabei ein muss.  gjon/cordelia "
my stay in his house was very nice! the house was very clean and tidy and he was a good host as well. the accommodation is very close to the tram stop and also easy to access to central. the cat living there is so pretty!
"a cosy well situated appartment, a wellcoming host, definitely a nice place to stay in amsterdam!!"
"michele is a quiet and warm heated gentleman. his apartment is very clean and tidy. i appreciated the free milk, juice,coffee and bread. it was a great experience in amsterdam. big thanks to michele! "
"michele was so nice since the first time! when i arrived the weather was terrible, he let me an umbrella and offered breakfast! the flat was really clean, the room so comfortable, and i completely fell in love with the cat!!!"
merci à michele pour son accueil.   appartement agréable.   très bon séjour à amsterdam
parfaite expérience à amsterdam !  appartement au pied d un arrêt de tram  (12-13-14) et de bus à 1/4h du centre ville! michèle est discret! cuisine disponible! par contre il ne faut pas craindre son chat qui est adorable !
"michele's place was nice and tidy. it was pretty easy to reach it from central station. the position itself is great! really nice place, recommended! "
"4 giorni fantastici. l'appartamento è molto accogliente e caldo, anche grazie alla presenza della piccola patsy"
"we havent seen him too much but i can say michele is a good guy, but house is more dirty and older than photos that i see. and actually bed sheets were'nt clean enough, even there were stains a little bit. fragtant room spray used. (we payed 15€ for cleaninf extra, what for?)toilet and kitchen were clean and usefull, thx for breakfest bread,good coffee, milk. and patsy cat was so cute, we loved her. but the hause must be more clean where a cat lives there. first day wifi was not work, after it was fixed, but we couldnt connect from our room good enough, connect quality was very poor. to centrial bus station(18) so close to home, tram station(13) after 5min walk. "
le propriétaire est très arrangeant et courtois. il nous a fait confiance.  la chambre est petite mais correcte.  l'emplacement est bien situé pour aller en centre ville à vélo ou par le transport en commun.  je recommande.  hervé 
michele was very kind and organized  we had a very nice stay in amsterdam at his place  thanks again  kisses to the nice cat !
it was a great stay. we felt truly welcome. the neighborhood was next to the center. the room and shower were tidy as well. so our expectations very fully met. michele himself was nice and very friendly. but the real show stealer was patsy - that cat was something! we recommend wholeheartedly staying at michele's.
michele made as fill very welcome. the room was very cosy and very good valeu for money.
"we had a great stay at michele's place. the room is exactly as described and the beds are comfortable.  michele's place is clean and tastefully decorated, and is very conveniently located near both bus and tram stops.  michele was very friendly and helpful, and provided useful advice on getting around amsterdam. he communicated clearly with us before our arrival, and welcomed us when we did arrive.  the flat is comfortable, and inhabited by michele's very sweet and friendly cat. the facilities are as described, and michele provided us with coffee and a basic breakfast each morning.  we had a very pleasant stay."
"we enjoyed our stay at michele's place. the description was accurate and he made arrangements to meet us. the room is small but clean and comfortable, in a good neighborhood, close to public transportation and near a wonderful park. we loved the cat!"
"cheap and pleasant stay close to the city center, near bus and tram stops. the room and the flat are clean and tidy and beds are comfortable. michele is very nice and helpful. a basic breakfast is included. highly reccomended!"
"apartamento muito bom, limpo e agradável. comunicação com michelle também foi muito boa. ficamos amigos do seu gato também"
"espectacular! la verdad que todo excelente, michele nos recibió muy bien y nos brindó todas las comodidades ! el lugar es súper limpio y está muy bien ubicado del centro ! sin duda volvería a hospedarme acá. "
michele made us feel very welcome in his flat.   the location was a short 30m walk to the centre or a quick tram in and was perfect for sightseeing. 
"michele was great, got in contact before. his sister was there to meet us and show us the apartment and make suggestions for the local neighbourhood. good location, bars restaurants and parks nearby. apartment very clean and a very friendly cat!"
"michele's place was fantastic. the apartment was very nice and comfortable and the neighbourhood was relatively quiet. there is a nice park close by and trams/buses are conventionally right outside the front door which will take you wherever you need to go. we had a soft spot for michele's cat patsy, who is probably the friendliest cat i've ever come across. unfortunately michele was injured and in hospital during our stay, but he did a great job in making sure everything was prepared and helped us with any questions.     cheers    james "
michele was a great host. he gave clear directions to his place which was easy to locate. the apartment is a few tram stops away to the city (anne frank house) and major train stations (amsterdam sloterdijk) which is convenient for travelling. his place is clean and i personally love the bathroom - big and clean. the apartment is very clean. i have skin allergies and it didn't give me any problem when i was there (june 2016). i would highly recommend this place if you don't mind climbing 2 flights of stairs. 
"michele was very welcoming and had a great apartment. it was easy to get around amsterdam from his house. we rented bikes and biked to all of the main sites from his place. there is also a bus right outside his apartment that takes you to the city center. the beds were very comfortable and the room has a large closet. overall, i recommend staying at his apartment. "
"michele was very kind! greeted us at the door and gave us a tour of his place. he was injured at the time, so we didn't see him much. he allowed us to use his espresso machine, as well as cereal, milk, and orange juice. i felt very comfortable at his place. there is a lock for your door, apartment door, and the main building. there is a tram right outside of his door that takes you to the the main center."
had a wonderful stay with michele! his apartment was perfect for two travelers. i also adored his cat! she was incredibly sweet and a lot of fun. 
"michele had de pech dat hij net terug was uit het ziekenhuis na een motor ongeluk, maar hij had zijn schoonmaakster ingeschakeld om het huis in orde te maken. michele is een prima gastheer en had ons van tevoren goed ingelicht over het aanreizen etc. het appartement ligt super praktisch bij 2 tramlijnen (12 en 14) en dichtbij supermarkten etc. fijn dat we onze kamer af konden sluiten indien gewenst. volledig tevreden over ons verblijf."
i thoroughly enjoyed staying at michele's place during my trip. all the accommodations in the listing were provided and his place suited my needs perfectly for my stay in amsterdam. michele was also very helpful in helping me find good local shops and restaurants along with helping me find my way around the city. his apartment was close to the downtown area and other major sights in amsterdam.  i would highly recommend michele's apartment to anyone visiting amsterdam.  
clean and tidy apartment. michele was nice and his cat is really funny.  the room was a bit tiny for 2 persons plus our luggages and a bit noisy due to the proximity of the street and cars.
"michele was very friendly and accomodating.    the house is super well connected to the center and to the station, as well as being really cozy.    i was staying with a friend and the guest room is big enough for a couple people as it is also provided with a small wardrobe.    we had a great time, truly recommended.     "
linda casa muy cómoda y limpia. excelente desayuno. recomendable.  el anfitrión nos trato muy servicial.
고양이가 애교도 많고 귀여웠어요
"we had a very nice weekend in amsterdam.  the appartment was perfect (near the center, easy access, perfect host).  thank you again for these two days at your place."
"bon accueil, chambre condortable. logement à proximité du centre (20 minutes à pieds). a recommander good welcome, comfortable room. apartment near the city center. to recommend."
"the listing was as described and in a quiet comfortable neighbourhood. trams were at your door and an easy ride into the centre for all you exploring and shopping needs. michele was a great host, we had tea, coffee, juice and cereal available to us and his cat is very adorable! we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend. "
michele's place was lovely. the tram stop is right outside the door and has excellent connections to everywhere in the city. the apartment is very clean and comfortable. patsy the cat is super friendly and loved attention. thank you for hosting us for our first airbnb experience michele!
"the room is fantastic as the photos show, very near from the tram station that leaves you in the centre. michele was a great host. the experience was great!"
"this place is fantastic for a good immersion in the city and its life.  room is like describe on the website page.  thanks to michele for is welcome and kindness.  pasty (his cat) is lovely !     there is convenient transport network direct in front of the apartment, all day and night. very useful for quick and short travels in central town     i highly recommend this place.. thanks for all"
"todo tal cual la descripcion. a pocos minutos de la zona centrica con el bus y el tram. todas la comodidades, zona residencial con supermercado cerca. latinos tengan en cuenta que en amsterdam la gente cena  a las 6. a pesar de estar indicado el uso de la cocina hasta las 9, nosotras, que cenamos recien a esa hora la utilizamos un poco mas tarde y no hubo problemas. tambien sepan que la gente es estrictamente correcta. no esperen trato afectuoso."
very good value. fantastic location- only 35mins walk to centre. the room is comfortable and clean.
"good location, close to the center, cute cat"
"michels sted var mye som på bildene.hyggelig og rent. han har vaskehjelp. han har også en flott, sosial katt. så du bør like katter. bratt trapp til bolig - så du bør være funksjonsfrisk. nydelig kaffe på morgen - tilgang på printer. rent kjøleskap som du kan sette mat i. det var hyggelig oppredd med håndklær på sengen. michel var høflig, tilbaketrukket og hjelpsom. skrev ut forskjellige buss/ togforbindelser i forbindelser med turer. framstod veldig ansvarlig og ordentlig. mye trafikk i veikrysset nedenfor vinduet. anbefaler "" sov i ro "" til ørene. relativ kort avstand til kanalene og fantastiske jordan området. morsomt å leie sykler. flott måte å komme seg rundt på. amsterdam var en blanding av veneszia og new york - men også noe helt eget.   "
"è andato tutto bene, l' host è stato molto disponibile e gentile e ci siamo trovati bene."
"my friend and i didn't meet michele in person but she was very responsive, friendly and provide all information we needed. we felt at home really. and even cuddle her cat patsy. the lowlight was that my friend got back from the marathon in an unexpected warm day and opened the window - i was still out - and apparently broke the handle or, it was defected previously. i can't assure it. but the main point was that michele was patient and provided feedback immediately with the outcome of the repair. i will always be grateful."
this is a great apt that is conveniently located near public transit lines. the cat is a lovely touch and can't get enough attention. i highly recommend trying razmataz nearby.  
michele's apartment was clean and our host arrived perfectly on time. we enjoyed are stay. we also enjoyed the company of patsy the cat.
we were welcome to use kitchen and dining room. michele was friendly and relaxed and made us welcome but left us in peace. patsy the cat very sweet and funny. room is basic but very clean warm and comfortable. location very convenient for transport and felt safe. right on main road but not too noisy. nice.
"michele is a very nice and helpful host. we were contacted a few days before arrival and checkin went very smoothly. he recommended the places to go and which trams to use around his area. the entire place is clean and tidy, nice beds and bathroom. the cat is a lovely welcome as well. will definitely recommend for people visiting amsterdam"
"michele a été très accueillant ainsi que son chat, n'hésitez pas à lui demander conseil! un arrêt de tram et de bus se trouve juste en dessous de l'appartement, donc très pratique pour parcourir amsterdam. il est même possible de rejoindre le centre ville à pied.  je conseille vivement ce logement !"
"michele was really friendly and welcoming. the apartment and the room were very clean and comfortable. while the place is not in the center it is right next to two tram lines. my only minor complain was that even if the internet was working very well, the wi-fi signal in the room was weak. overall, i would clearly recommend michele's place to anyone visiting amsterdam! :-)"
"alloggio comodo, pulito e spazioso.  servito con comodità dai mezzi pubblici.  io e la mia fidanzata ci siamo trovato molto bene.  michele è un ottima persona, è molto disponibile!   la presenza della gattina pazzy, rallegra ancora di più la casa!   b&b consigliatissimo!"
"michele es una persona prudente y respetuosa. nos informó de todo lo que le solicitamos y nos ofreció café y te gratis para el desayuno, lo cual se agradeció. la casa es tranquila, cálida y bien situada. respondió totalmente al anuncio publicado."
"we had a great time at michele's. the flat is lovely, very clean and this is a quiet location so you will have a good night sleep. we were only 15min from the city centre by foot, which was great! there are a few nice places around for restaurants and breakfast places. michele was accommodating and patient as we arrived a bit late. and he was very discrete the rest of our stay. we would definitely go back when in amsterdam."
"michele è stato molto gentile, ci ha forniro indicazioni utili per orientarci in città e ci ha messo a disposizione gli spazi comuni, proprio come indicato nell'annuncio. l'uso del microonde e del frigo è stato molto comodo per prepararci alcuni pasti, anche in considerazione dei prezzi elevati della città. ottimo livello di pulizia e posizione comoda, consigliato!"
a good value place to stay it's a little bit out but served well by trams and buses so all in all a good choice for the price you pay.
